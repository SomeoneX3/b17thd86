<P class="p25 ft4">The Dark Lord Ascending</P>
<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>he two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the nar- row, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands di- rected at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other , they</P>
<P class="p27 ft9">stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.</P>
<P class="p28 ft10">“News?” asked the taller of the two. ”The best,” replied Severus Snape.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">The lane was bordered on the left by wild, <NOBR>low-growing</NOBR> brambles, on the right by a high, nearly manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks ﬂapped around their ankles as they marched.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging tress broke the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisﬁed. You should conﬁdent that your reception will be good?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide drive- way that led off the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive <NOBR>wrought-iron</NOBR> gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke step; In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">smoke.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The yew hedges mufﬂed the sound of the men’s footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right; Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a <NOBR>pure-white</NOBR> peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . . ” Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the <NOBR>diamond-paned</NOBR> downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crack- led beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The hallway was large, dimly light, and sumptuously decorated, with a magniﬁcent carpet covering most of the stone ﬂoor. The eyes of the <NOBR>pale-faced</NOBR> portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.</P>
<P class="p31 ft11">The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring ﬁre beneath a handsome marble man- telpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a mo- ment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scenes an apparently uncon- scious human ﬁgure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reﬂected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Yaxley, Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. “You are very nearly late.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">The speaker was seated directly in front of the ﬁreplace, so that it was difﬁ- cult, at ﬁrst, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">9</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">drew nearer, however, this face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indication the seat on his immediate right. <NOBR>“Yaxley—beside</NOBR> Dolohov.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke ﬁrst.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“So?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">The interest around the table sharpened palpably; Some stiffened, others ﬁdgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or two. Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.</P>
<P class="p47 ft10">“Good. very good. And this information <NOBR>comes—”</NOBR> <NOBR>“—from</NOBR> the source we discussed,” said Snape. “My Lord.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“My Lord, I have heard differently,”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Yaxley waited but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Snape was smiling,</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the ﬁrst time; he is known to be susceptible.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said Yaxley.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape. “I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Ofﬁce will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have inﬁltrated the Ministry.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body re- volving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the <NOBR>boy—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watch- ing resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchant- ments to break through the rest.”</P>
<P class="p54 ft9">“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the ﬁrelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I <NOBR>have—with</NOBR> difﬁculty, and after great <NOBR>effort—succeeded</NOBR> in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9"><NOBR>“Yes—my</NOBR> Lord, that is <NOBR>true—buy</NOBR> you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_11">


<P class="p40 ft2">11</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry depart- ments. I will, I think, be easy now that we have such a <NOBR>high-ranking</NOBR> ofﬁcial under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.”</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. if we cannot touch the boy at his destination, the it must be done while he travels.”</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed de- termined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust every- thing to do with the place.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “ I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft12">The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, bu his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the <NOBR>best-laid</NOBR> plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">terrible, <NOBR>drawn-out</NOBR> cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spo- ken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Yes, <NOBR>m-my</NOBR> Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at ﬁrst glance, to be un- occupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">The faces around his displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the ﬁrelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“My Lord?”</P>
<P class="p65 ft9">“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.” “I . . . ”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim ﬁngers closed brieﬂy on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in from of his red eyes, examining it closely.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“What is it?”</P>
<P class="p67 ft10">“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy. “And the core?” <NOBR>“Dragon—dragon</NOBR> heartstring.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_13">


<P class="p68 ft2">13</P>
<P class="p69 ft10">“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a sec- ond, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s want in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.</P>
<P class="p70 ft9">“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?” Some of the throng sniggered.</P>
<P class="p71 ft10">“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late . . . What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?”</P>
<P class="p72 ft9"><NOBR>“Nothing—nothing,</NOBR> my Lord!” “Such lies, Lucius . . . ”</P>
<P class="p73 ft12">The soft voice seems to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the ﬂoor beneath the table.</P>
<P class="p74 ft10">The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose, seem- ingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders; its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, un- blinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin ﬁngers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.</P>
<P class="p75 ft9">“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”</P>
<P class="p76 ft9">“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire <NOBR>it—we</NOBR> do.”</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Volde- mort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terriﬁed to make eye contact.</P>
<P class="p78 ft10">“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longer for closeness.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you,”</P>
<P class="p79 ft9">Her face ﬂooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight. “My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft9">She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. “I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And your, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks, a few thumped the table with their ﬁsts. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant where that at Bel- latrix and the Malfoys’ humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently ﬂushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.</P>
<P class="p81 ft12">“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth. <NOBR>“We—Narcissa</NOBR> and <NOBR>I—have</NOBR> never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the cubs?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the oppo- site wall.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. “Enough.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_15">


<P class="p84 ft2">15</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">And the laughter died at once.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring. “You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of grati- tude again. “At the ﬁrst chance!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the world</P>
<P class="p87 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">. . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain . . . ”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving ﬁgure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny ﬂick. The ﬁgure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the ﬁrelight, the woman said in a cracked and terriﬁed voice. “Severus! Help me!”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his <NOBR>wand-free</NOBR> hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. now that the woman had woken, he seems unable to look at her anymore.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage, who until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</P>
<P class="p90 ft9">There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from us . . . ”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">One of the Death Eaters spat on the ﬂoor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Severus . . . please . . . please . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, and Char- ity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned de- fense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept those thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance . . . She would have use all mate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">Nobody laughed this time; There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from his again.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Avada Kedavra.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">The ﬂash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.</P>

<P class="p96 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">H</SPAN>arry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and sweat- ing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He had trodden on a cup of cold</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">tea that had been sitting on the ﬂoor outside his bedroom door. “What <NOBR>the—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft14">He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his ﬁnger under the tap.</P>
<P class="p36 ft11">It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his ﬁnger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of <NOBR>it—particularly</NOBR> in light of his immediate <NOBR>plans—it</NOBR> seemed a serious ﬂaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p100 ft11">Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the ﬁrst time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the <NOBR>bottom—old</NOBR> quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer ﬁt. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth ﬁnger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that ﬂickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and <NOBR>worn-out</NOBR> Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he ﬁnally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two- <NOBR>inch-long</NOBR> fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.</P>
<P class="p101 ft10">Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reﬂected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occa- sioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.</P>

His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, <NOBR>potion-making</NOBR> kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been</P>

<P class="p59 ft11">This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer.</P>
<P class="p102 ft10">He got up off the ﬂoor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to ﬂick through the newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl as asleep, or else faking: she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.</P>
<P class="p103 ft2">ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED</P>
<P class="p104 ft2">by Elphias Doge</P>
<P class="p105 ft11">I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our ﬁrst day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and <NOBR>well-publicized</NOBR> attack upon three young Muggles.</P>
<P class="p106 ft2">Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in</P>

<P class="p107 ft11">Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad busi- ness, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a <NOBR>Muggle-hater.</NOBR> They could not have been more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest <NOBR>anti-Muggle</NOBR> tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years.</P>
<P class="p108 ft11">In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his ﬁrst year he would never again be known as the son of a <NOBR>Muggle-hater,</NOBR> but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends beneﬁted from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.</P>
<P class="p108 ft11">He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magi- cal names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated al- chemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waf- ﬂing, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transﬁguration Today, Chal- lenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s fu- ture career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions.</P>
<P class="p109 ft10">Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by</P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_21">


<P class="p68 ft2">21</P>
<P class="p110 ft14">dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother.</P>
<P class="p111 ft11">When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then- traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.</P>
<P class="p112 ft14">That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the ex- periments of Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his <NOBR>day-to-day</NOBR> life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with hor- ror that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet an- other tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.</P>
<P class="p113 ft10">Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound ef- fect on both of her brothers. All those closest to <NOBR>Albus-and</NOBR> I count myself one of that lucky <NOBR>number-agree</NOBR> that Ariana’s death, and Al- bus’s feeling of personal responsibility for it (though of course, he</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore.</P>
<P class="p114 ft11">I returned home to ﬁnd a young man who had experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would <NOBR>lift-in</NOBR> later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them.</P>
<P class="p115 ft12">Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the state of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will beneﬁt generations to come, as will the wisdom he dis- played in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who wit- nessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore’s triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are consid- ered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of <NOBR>He-Who-</NOBR> <NOBR>Must–Not-Be-Named.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p116 ft11">Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could ﬁnd some- thing to value in anyone, however apparently insigniﬁcant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great human- ity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts head- masters cannot be in question. He died as he lived, working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met</P>

<P class="p117 ft2">him.</P>
<P class="p118 ft12">Harry ﬁnished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his <NOBR>half-moon</NOBR> spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of betraying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of hu- miliation.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never one had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and <NOBR>silver-haired</NOBR> and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly <NOBR>Blast-Ended</NOBR> Skrewt.</P>
<P class="p120 ft12">He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowl- edge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumble- dore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only on he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:</P>
<P class="p121 ft2">“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the ﬁrst volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the news- paper into the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the <NOBR>rolled-up</NOBR> paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after nothing that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:</P>
<P class="p124 ft2"><NOBR>DUMBLEDORE—THE</NOBR> TRUTH AT LAST?</P>
<P class="p125 ft11">Coming next week, the shocking story of the ﬂawed genius con- sidered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Strip- ping away the popular image of serene, <NOBR>silver-bearded</NOBR> wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the life- long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?</P>
<P class="p126 ft10">The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside.</P>
<P class="p127 ft10">Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jew- eled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her ﬁngers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_25">


<P class="p40 ft2">25</P>
<P class="p128 ft10">In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her fa- mously ferocious <NOBR>quill-portraits</NOBR> might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.</P>
<P class="p129 ft14">“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure my book will be the ﬁrst of very, very many.” Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine- hundred page book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumb- ledore’s mysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.</P>
<P class="p130 ft10">“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world as clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the ﬁrst to meet that need.”</P>
<P class="p131 ft10">I mentioned the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate frog card.”</P>
<P class="p132 ft2">Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.</P>
<P class="p131 ft10">“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.”</P>
<P class="p133 ft12">And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraor- dinary life?</P>
<P class="p105 ft10">“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, “you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word</P>

<P class="p134 ft11">‘no,’ and a nice sharp <NOBR>Quick-Quotes</NOBR> Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you <NOBR>know—he</NOBR> trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumb- ledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.”</P>
<P class="p135 ft10">The advance publicity of Skeeter’s biography has certainly sug- gested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dum- bledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask?</P>
<P class="p136 ft11">“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the highlights be- fore anybody’s bought the book!” laughs Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody hearing him rage against <NOBR>you-Know-Who</NOBR> would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly <NOBR>broad-minded</NOBR> when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very ﬁshy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.”</P>
<P class="p137 ft10">I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s brother, Aber- forth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal ﬁfteen years ago.</P>
<P class="p138 ft10">“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap.” laughs Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about much worse than a brother with a fond- ness for ﬁddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle- maiming <NOBR>father-Dumbledore</NOBR> couldn’t keep either of them quiet any- way, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of <NOBR>nastiness—but,</NOBR> as I say, you’ll have to wait for chap-</P>

<P class="p140 ft9">ters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.”</P>
<P class="p141 ft9">Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the bril- liance that led to Dumbledore’s many magical discoveries?</P>
<P class="p142 ft10">“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achieve- ments. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”</P>
<P class="p143 ft9">But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s achievements can- not, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald?</P>
<P class="p144 ft10">“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those who go dewy eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell— or perhaps a Dungbomb. very dirty business indeed. All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of</P>
<P class="p145 ft2">his wand and came quietly!”</P>
<P class="p114 ft10">Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing sub- ject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other.</P>
<P class="p146 ft10">“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an entire chap- ter to the whole <NOBR>Potter-Dumbledore</NOBR> relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s best <NOBR>interests—well,</NOBR> we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.”</P>
<P class="p147 ft9">I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which</P>

<P class="p148 ft9">Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> had returned.</P>
<P class="p149 ft12">“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Pot- ter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing mo- ments of his <NOBR>life—the</NOBR> Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”</P>
<P class="p150 ft10">Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore’s ﬁnal hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died?</P>
<P class="p151 ft10">“well, I don’t wan to say too <NOBR>much—it’s</NOBR> all in the <NOBR>book—but</NOBR> the eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? that is for the Wizarding community to <NOBR>decide—once</NOBR> they’ve read my book.”</P>
<P class="p152 ft10">On that intriguing note, I take my leave. there can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller, Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero.</P>
<P class="p153 ft10">Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspa- per and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overﬂowing bin.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole <NOBR>Potter-Dumbledore</NOBR> relationship . . .

<P class="p71 ft10">Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his ﬁngers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him . . . .</P>
<P class="p156 ft14">A ﬂash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut ﬁnger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choos- ing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reﬂect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him.</P>
<P class="p157 ft10">He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again.</P>

<P class="p39 ft9">“Don’t you talk in that <NOBR>tone—”</NOBR> began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vern Dursley waved her down.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amuse- ment. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every <NOBR>twenty-four</NOBR> hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking ad repacking the car with every change of heart.

<P class="p167 ft11">“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and down the living room, <NOBR>“we—Petunia,</NOBR> Dudley, and <NOBR>I—are</NOBR> in danger. From— <NOBR>from—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“Some of my ’my lot,’ right,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it’s over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of <NOBR>hocus-pocus</NOBR> and before we know it the deeds will my in your name <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_33">


<P class="p40 ft2">33</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“Don’t you <NOBR>dare—!”</NOBR> squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he has spotted.</P>
<P class="p169 ft10">“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?” There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with</P>
<P class="p170 ft2">this argument.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord <NOBR>Thing—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10"><NOBR>“—Voldemort,”</NOBR> said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. <NOBR>Weasley—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p172 ft10">Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward of recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10"><NOBR>“—Kingsley</NOBR> and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on re- morselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and ﬁnd out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The <NOBR>next-door</NOBR> neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.</P>

<P class="p92 ft9">“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. “There is,” said Harry, surprised.</P>
<P class="p173 ft10">“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!”</P>
<P class="p174 ft10">Harry laughed; he could not stop himself. It was so typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.</P>
<P class="p175 ft9">“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. “We think the Ministry has been inﬁltrated.”</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">Uncle Vernon stroke to the ﬁreplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great black mustache tippled, his face still purple with concentration.</P>
<P class="p177 ft10">“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”</P>
<P class="p175 ft9">Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difﬁculty. This question has also been addressed half a dozen times.</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth. “Kingsley is protecting the <NOBR>Mug—I</NOBR> mean, your Prime Minister.”</P>
<P class="p176 ft14"><NOBR>“Exactly—he’s</NOBR> the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank tele- vision screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in.</P>
<P class="p109 ft9">“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the <NOBR>job—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p176 ft9">“If we’d even seen CVs . . . ” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set him-</P>

<P class="p43 ft10">“These accidents aren’t <NOBR>accidents—the</NOBR> crashes and explosions and derail- ments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the new. People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind <NOBR>it—Voldemort.</NOBR> I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the <NOBR>fogs—they’re</NOBR> caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!”</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">. . . more of them?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed of fear and <NOBR>despair—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your <NOBR>point—”</NOBR> “I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of <NOBR>them—Death</NOBR> Eaters, dementors, maybe even <NOBR>Inferi—which</NOBR> means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark <NOBR>Wizard—will</NOBR> be able to ﬁnd you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree</P>
<P class="p181 ft2">you need help.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing something down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the inter- vening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was star- ing at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work? What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout <NOBR>wizards—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p182 ft9">“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and kill you like they did my parents!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft2">“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, <NOBR>“Dad—I’m</NOBR> going with these Order peo- ple.”</P>
<P class="p183 ft9">“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the ﬁrst time in your life, you’re talking sense.” He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be no question</P>

<P class="p185 ft9">of being separated from their Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.</P>
<P class="p186 ft10">“They’ll be here in about ﬁve minutes,” he said, and when none of the Durs- leys replied, he left the room. The prospect of <NOBR>parting—probably</NOBR> <NOBR>forever—from</NOBR> his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?</P>
<P class="p187 ft10">Back in his bedroom, Harry ﬁddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of own nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.</P>
<P class="p175 ft9">“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll be able to ﬂy again.”</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own.</P>
<P class="p174 ft10">“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door, a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”</P>
<P class="p176 ft10">“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the <NOBR>dark-haired</NOBR> Hestia. “It’s really good of you to do this . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin . . . ”</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.</P>
<P class="p108 ft10">“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your <NOBR>house—Harry</NOBR> being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest <NOBR>him—we</NOBR> shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_37">


<P class="p40 ft2">37</P>
<P class="p189 ft9">for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon politely. “Know how <NOBR>to—?</NOBR> Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboo- zled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he was ﬂattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing con- ﬁdence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus or Hestia seemed to hear him.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change in the <NOBR>arrangements—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> was going to come and take me by <NOBR>Side-Along-Apparition?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. <NOBR>“Mad-Eye</NOBR> will explain.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incompre- hension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus, nod- ding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “We are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family’s Disapparition, Harry: thus, the charm breaks as the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Well, this is <NOBR>good-bye,</NOBR> then, boy.”</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his ﬁst and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her hand- bag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, remind- ing Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I don’t understand.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at her son.</P>
<P class="p194 ft10">Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. “Why isn’t he coming with us?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Well, <NOBR>he—he</NOBR> doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and asking, “You don’t want to, do you?”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on, we’re off.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">It seems that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difﬁcult to put into words. After sever moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_39">


<P class="p40 ft2">39</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked, looking bewildered.</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry,” Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">follow.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Off with some of our lot?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before. Witches and wizards seems stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“It’s ﬁne,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. “Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What dangers you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the <NOBR>anti-Voldemort</NOBR> movement?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9"><NOBR>“Er—no,</NOBR> they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a wast of space actually, but I’m used <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I don’t think you’re a wast of space.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing. Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expres- sion before mumbling, “You saved my life.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would have taken</P>
<P class="p198 ft2">. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so brieﬂy and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into <NOBR>scarlet-faced</NOBR> silence.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9"><NOBR>“S—so</NOBR> sweet, Dudders . . . ” she sobbed into his massive chest. <NOBR>“S-such</NOBR> a lovely <NOBR>b-boy . . .</NOBR> <NOBR>s-saying</NOBR> thank you . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ’I love you,”’ said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. “I though we were on a tight schedule!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10"><NOBR>“Yes—yes,</NOBR> we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these ex- changes with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. “We really must be off, <NOBR>Harry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his own.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9"><NOBR>“—good</NOBR> luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Oh,” said Harry. “right. Thanks.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our thoughts go with you.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle lightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked to- ward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs. “did the</P>

<P class="p84 ft2">41</P>
<P class="p199 ft9">dementors blow a different personality into you?” “Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Yeah . . . ” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it. “Maybe. Take care, Big D.”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.</P>
<P class="p201 ft10">Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to ﬁnd herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, “Well— <NOBR>good-bye,”</NOBR> and marched toward the door without looking at him.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“Good-bye,”</NOBR> said Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him. She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.</P>

<P class="p203 ft10">Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his un- naturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and ﬂicked through the channels to his heart’s con- tent. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.</P>
<P class="p204 ft2">“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who 43</P>

<P class="p208 ft9">Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p209 ft10">Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.</P>
<P class="p210 ft11">“And under here, <NOBR>Hedwig”—Harry</NOBR> pulled open a door under the <NOBR>stairs—“is</NOBR> where I used to sleep; You never knew me <NOBR>then—Blimey,</NOBR> it’s small, I’d forgot- ten. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p211 ft14">Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. but Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving ﬂashes of green light and once— Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted <NOBR>it—a</NOBR> ﬂy- ing motorbike . . .</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straight- ened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he stag- gered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.</P>
<P class="p212 ft14">The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, ﬁgures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_45">


<P class="p84 ft2">45</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione ﬂung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, ”All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Deﬁnitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I wasn’t expect- ing this many of you!”</P>
<P class="p214 ft12">“Change of plan,” growled <NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to gar- den with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.”</P>
<P class="p213 ft11">Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and <NOBR>long-haired;</NOBR> Mr. Weasley, <NOBR>kind-faced,</NOBR> bald- ing, his spectacles a little awry; <NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> <NOBR>battle-worn,</NOBR> <NOBR>one-legged,</NOBR> his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her fa- vorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beau- tiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, taller and <NOBR>broad-shouldered;</NOBR> Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy bloodhound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?” he called across the room.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley. “You’re more important.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing ma- chine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.</P>
<P class="p215 ft9">“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. “I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“That’s brilliant, <NOBR>congrat—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy <NOBR>catch-up</NOBR> later,” roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry, “As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done int he name of your protection to prevent <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What he’s really done is to stop you from getting out of here safely.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Second problem. You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I <NOBR>don’t—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The Trace, the Trace!” said <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> impatiently. “The charm that detects magical activity around <NOBR>under-seventeens,</NOBR> the way the Ministry ﬁnds out out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seven- teen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius Thick- nesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.”</P>
<P class="p216 ft9">Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. “So what are we going to do?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Harry could see ﬂaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad- Eye the chance to address them.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, <NOBR>or”—Moody</NOBR> gestured around the pristine <NOBR>kitchen—“you</NOBR> no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_47">


<P class="p40 ft2">47</P>
<P class="p217 ft9">again, correct?” Harry nodded.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“so this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’ve choosing to break ti early, because the alternative is waiting for <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.</P>
<P class="p57 ft11">“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that <NOBR>You-Know-who</NOBR> doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> we’re dealing with, so we can’t just rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly auntie <NOBR>Muriel’s—you</NOBR> get the idea.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gap- ing hole in the plan.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10"><NOBR>“Er—yes,”</NOBR> said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at ﬁrst, but won’t it be sort of obvious <NOBR>once”—he</NOBR> per- formed a quick <NOBR>headcount—“fourteen</NOBR> of us ﬂy off towards Tonks’s parents’?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Ah,” said Moody. “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be ﬂying to Tonks’s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a dif- ferent safe house.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a ﬂask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No way!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft2">“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint of compla- cency.</P>
<P class="p219 ft10">“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their <NOBR>lives—!”</NOBR> <NOBR>“—because</NOBR> it’s the ﬁrst time for all of us,” said Ron. “This is different, pretending to be <NOBR>me—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly. “Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, sccrawny gits forever.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Harry did not smile.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.” “Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously there’s no chance</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic: we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry.</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.” Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But this is mad, there’s no <NOBR>need—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“No need!” snarled Moody, “With <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> out there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> can’t split himself into seven.”</P>
<P class="p224 ft9">Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once. “so, <NOBR>Potter—some</NOBR> of your hair, if you please.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_49">


<P class="p84 ft2">49</P>
<P class="p225 ft9">Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a <NOBR>just-do-it</NOBR> sort of way. “Now!” barked Moody.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">With all of their eyes on him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the ﬂask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made con- tact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you now what I <NOBR>mean—Goyle’s</NOBR> potion looked like bogies.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please.” said Moody.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“We’re one short,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Here,” said Hagrid grufﬂy, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I’ve told yer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said <NOBR>You-Know-who</NOBR> would want to ﬁnish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”</P>
<P class="p226 ft10">Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen <NOBR>eggcup-sized</NOBR> glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“Altogether, then . . . ”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats. At once, their features be-</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">gan to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shoot- ing upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Fred and George turned to each other and said together, <NOBR>“Wow—we’re</NOBR> iden- tical!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I dunno, though. I think I’m still better looking,” said Fred , examining his reﬂection in the kettle.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t look at <NOBR>me—I’m</NOBR> ’ideous.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said Moody, indicating the ﬁrst sack, ” and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft14">The real Harry thought this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, and stufﬁng their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have with their own.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I knew Ginny was lying about that that tattoo,” said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she put on glasses. Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each contain-</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">ing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Good,” said Moody, as at last the seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage- laden Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by <NOBR>broom—”</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_51">


<P class="p84 ft2">51</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.</P>
<P class="p229 ft11">“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued. “Arthur and <NOBR>Fred—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing, “Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Sorry, <NOBR>George—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I’m only yanking your wand. I’m Fred <NOBR>really—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Enough messing around!!” snarled Moody. “The other <NOBR>one—George</NOBR> or Fred or whoever you <NOBR>are—you’re</NOBR> with Remus. Miss <NOBR>Delacour—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of brooms.” Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that</P>
<P class="p230 ft9">Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. “Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by <NOBR>thestral—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too lacked conﬁdence on a broomstick.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all right?” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, “I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. Come on . . . ”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s cage and fol- lowed the ground to the dark back garden.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands. Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could ﬁt yeh in one hand!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely uncomfortable.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a few tricks up its hindquarters now. Tha’ one was my idea.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">He pointed a thick ﬁnger at a purple button near the speedometer.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure this was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion’s lost’.’</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Everybody mounted their brooms.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life. It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate.</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody, “See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . . THREE.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_53">


<P class="p40 ft2">53</P>
<P class="p56 ft11">a nasty lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes water slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too, the long black tail of a threstral ﬂicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive, by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky—</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded ﬁgures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious—</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hed- wig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“No—HEDWIG!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the ﬂoor of the cage.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“No—NO!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p59 ft9">The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scat- tering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><NOBR>“Hedwig—Hedwig—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the ﬂoor of her cage. He could not take it in in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, ﬂares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were—</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the thun- derous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s cage into the ﬂoor, refusing to believe that she was dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”</P>

<P class="p231 ft9">“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and he opened the throttle.</P>
<P class="p186 ft11"><NOBR>“Stop—STOP!”</NOBR> Harry shouted, but he looked back again as two jets of green light ﬂew past his left year: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike, more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it.</P>
<P class="p109 ft11">“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do it for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick ﬁnger into a green button near the fuel gauge.</P>
<P class="p232 ft10">A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.</P>
<P class="p109 ft10">More Killing Curses ﬂew past Harry’s head from the two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of ﬁreworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening—</P>
<P class="p233 ft10">“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a sec- ond button. This time a great net burst from the bike’s exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the com- panion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.</P>
<P class="p234 ft9">“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_55">


<P class="p84 ft2">55</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon ﬁre burst from the exhaust, <NOBR>white-hot</NOBR> and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of ﬂame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown ﬂat onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his ﬂowery pink umbrella. “Hagrid! No! Let me!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“REPARO!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike com- pletely. Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike’s ﬂight, then the sidecar began to lose height—</P>
<P class="p235 ft9">In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted “Wingardium Leviosa!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming ﬁgures and yelled, “Impedimenta!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment the man was absurdly <NOBR>spread-eagled</NOBR> in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him—</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat—</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged him-</P>

<P class="p62 ft12">self onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself <NOBR>back-to-back</NOBR> with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo!”</P>
<P class="p236 ft10">He knew a dreadful, <NOBR>gut-wrenching</NOBR> pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his com- panion fell back and vanished.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried ter repair it <NOBR>myself—yeh’ve</NOBR> got no <NOBR>room—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It’s not a problem, just keep ﬂying!” Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged. Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon- ﬁre button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley <NOBR>Shunpike—Stan—</NOBR></P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike’s engine. Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and dis- appeared from view.</P>
<P class="p238 ft9">“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid, “Where’ve they gone?” “I don’t know!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">He clamored around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid’s jacket.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Hagrid, do the <NOBR>dragon-ﬁre</NOBR> thing again, let’s get out of here!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_57">


<P class="p40 ft2">57</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the <NOBR>white-blue</NOBR> ﬁre shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he had, Hagrid ﬂung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars—</P>
<P class="p240 ft2">“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!!” yelled Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sue would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had sitll had a wand. . . . It’s him . . . it’s the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . .</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Then the scar on his forehead burned like ﬁre: as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind—</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was ﬂying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his <NOBR>snake-like</NOBR> face gleaming out of the blackness, his white ﬁngers raising his wand again—</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells ﬂying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body ﬂy past him and knew he had hit one of them, but he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control—</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded ﬁgure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm—</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“NO!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick—</P>

<P class="p231 ft9">Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Volde- mort scream, “Mine!!”</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, <NOBR>“Avada—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p174 ft14">As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden ﬁre through his <NOBR>half-closed</NOBR> eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. the remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “No!”; Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the <NOBR>dragon-ﬁre</NOBR> button. He punched it with his <NOBR>wand-free</NOBR> hand and the bike shot more ﬂames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground.</P>
<P class="p100 ft9">“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. <NOBR>“Hagrid—Accio</NOBR> Hagrid!”</P>
<P class="p241 ft10">The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the han- dlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer. He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!”</P>
<P class="p175 ft10">He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more—</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread- eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.</P>

<P class="p243 ft9">Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him: his hands sank into inches of muddy</P>
<P class="p203 ft12">water as he tried to stand. He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p244 ft10">“Hagrid? Hagrid. talk to <NOBR>me—”</NOBR> But the dark mass did not stir.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted, “They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Harry’s head was swimming.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Hagrid.” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the ﬂoor a short distance away, wed and muddy. A <NOBR>fair-haired,</NOBR> <NOBR>big-bellied</NOBR> man was watching Harry anxiously.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Hagrid’s ﬁne, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve ﬁxed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted <NOBR>Tonks—Dora’s</NOBR> father.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><NOBR>“Voldemort—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder and push- ing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley over- stretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death Eaters, loads of <NOBR>them—we</NOBR> were <NOBR>chased—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Death eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I <NOBR>thought—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“They knew,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through to the sky above.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished: it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order’s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_61">


<P class="p40 ft2">61</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“Harry!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the ﬂoor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Yeah, me too. I can’t <NOBR>believe—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. “Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm. “It fell tight</P>
<P class="p248 ft9">beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” “Oh, <NOBR>I’m—I’m</NOBR> sorry.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">As shed moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced. Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you were am- bushed; where is Nymphadora?”</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to anyone else.” She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the other had died, it was his fault, all</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair. . . .</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got to get back to the Burrow and ﬁnd <NOBR>out—then</NOBR> we’ll be able to send word, <NOBR>or—or</NOBR> Tonks will, once <NOBR>she’s—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Dora’ll be okay,’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she’s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s through here,” he added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoul- ders. <NOBR>“I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which eh felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">“I’ll tell <NOBR>Tonks—Dora—to</NOBR> send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, <NOBR>silver-backed</NOBR> hairbrush lying on the dressing table.</P>
<P class="p249 ft10">“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a ﬁnger on it, ready to leave. “Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s Hedwig?” “She . . . she got hit,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had bee his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.</P>
<P class="p228 ft10">Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. “Never mind,” he said grufﬂy. “Never mind. she had a great old <NOBR>life—”</NOBR> “Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue,</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">and Hagrid only just got his foreﬁnger to it in time.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrol- lably, his ﬁnger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed into hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throw- ing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?” cried Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p251 ft9">“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted. The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_63">


<P class="p40 ft2">63</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told her. “We were sur- rounded the moment we took <NOBR>off—they</NOBR> knew it was <NOBR>tonight—I</NOBR> don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p59 ft9">He could hear the <NOBR>self-justifying</NOBR> note in his voice, the pleas for her to un- derstand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but—</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little shakily. “Fer medicinal purposes?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back towards the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Ron and Tonks should have been back ﬁrst, but they missed their Portkey, it came back without them.” she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. “And that one,” she pointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,“ she checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">A blue light had appeared in the darkness; It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immedi- ately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched; One of George’s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck was drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.</P>
<P class="p252 ft9">“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!” Lupin ignored him.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“What creature sat in the corner the ﬁrst time that Harry Potter visited my ofﬁce at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake. “Answer me!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“A—a</NOBR> grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p253 ft9">Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. “Wha’ was that’ about?” roared Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“I’m sorry Harry, but I had to check” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve been be- trayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only peo- ple who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door.</P>
<P class="p254 ft9">“You’re <NOBR>half—giant,”</NOBR> said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened? How did you escape?”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry explained brieﬂy how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I . . . ” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_65">


<P class="p40 ft2">65</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead <NOBR>of—well,</NOBR> he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">Lupin looked aghast.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”</P>
<P class="p46 ft11">“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself and if I stunned him and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!! Expelliar- mus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added deﬁantly. Lupin was clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione ﬂung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder Ha reminding him of the sneering Hufﬂepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.</P>
<P class="p218 ft12">“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very un- usual move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the ﬁrst occasion was close to suicidal!”</P>
<P class="p256 ft9">“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily. “Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death <NOBR>Eaters—frankly,</NOBR> most people!—</P>
<P class="p257 ft10">would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of deﬁ- ance inside him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there.” said Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Lupin’s retort was last; Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down: it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">There was a scufﬂing from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.</P>
<P class="p30 ft14">Two ﬁgures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione ﬂung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.</P>
<P class="p259 ft9">“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!” “Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,” said Lupin calmly.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him, I’ve checked!” “All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak.</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">“But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft9">“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?” “Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”</P>
<P class="p260 ft9">Hermione stiﬂed a little moan behind her hand. “What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Followed by ﬁve, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley reeled off, “and we saw <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> as well, he joined the chase halfway through but van- ished pretty quickly. Remus, he <NOBR>can—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t understand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”</P>
<P class="p261 ft10">“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin. “Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?” Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh.</P>

<DIV id="page_67">


<P class="p40 ft2">67</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Traver’s hood fell off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George?”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“He lost an ear,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p262 ft9">“Lost <NOBR>an—?”</NOBR> repeated Hermione in a high voice. “Snape’s work,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Snape?” shouted Harry, “You didn’t <NOBR>say—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p218 ft12">“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was loosing so much blood.”</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unob- scured by ﬂying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, <NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> and Mundungus?</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George’s ear had been.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“How is he?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back, not when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse . . . He’s alive.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”</P>
<P class="p263 ft9">“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked. “Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft12">“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other. Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if you know what’s good for you!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.</P>
<P class="p264 ft9">“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!” “How is?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the ﬁrst time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing.</P>
<P class="p94 ft2">Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival, George stirred.</P>
<P class="p265 ft10">“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley. George’s ﬁngers groped at the side of his head. “Saintlike” he murmured.</P>
<P class="p266 ft2">“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terriﬁed: “Is his mind affected?”</P>
<P class="p267 ft9">“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. “You see . . . I’m holy. Holey. Fred: geddit?”</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color ﬂooded Fred’s pale face. “Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">related humor before you, you go for holey?”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his <NOBR>tear-soaked</NOBR> mother. “You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">He looked around.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Hi, <NOBR>Harry—you</NOBR> are Harry, right?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George, “Why aren’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s grin faded.</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">69</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned her to accompany him back outside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice,</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reach- ing the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slight- est breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves—</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground—</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“It’s them!” screamed Hermione.</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. “Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms.</P>
<P class="p270 ft9">His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione ﬂew at him and hugged him tightly.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I <NOBR>thought—I</NOBR> <NOBR>thought—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “’M ﬁne.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. “Won- derful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you’re aiming at a moving target from a ﬂying <NOBR>broom—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p127 ft2">“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck.</P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking free. “Are we the last back?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re okay, <NOBR>Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">She ran back inside.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks.</P>
<P class="p272 ft10">“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Reuse, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I’d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we deﬁnitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the contin- ued absence of Bill, Fleur, <NOBR>Mad-eye,</NOBR> and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley ﬁnally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.</P>
<P class="p273 ft10">“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.” “Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once. “How’s George?” asked Lupin.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_71">


<P class="p40 ft2">71</P>
<P class="p274 ft9">“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron. “He’s <NOBR>lost—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">But the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“Bill! Thank God, thank <NOBR>God—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunc- tory. Looking directly at his father, he said, <NOBR>“Mad-Eye’s</NOBR> dead.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just after we broke out of the circle: <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> and Dung were close by use, they were heading north too, <NOBR>Voldemort—he</NOBR> can <NOBR>ﬂy—went</NOBR> straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort’s curse hit <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> full in the face, he fell backward off his broom <NOBR>and—there</NOBR> was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own <NOBR>tail—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p121 ft2">Bill’s voice broke.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. <NOBR>Mad-Eye’s</NOBR> dead; it could not be . . . <NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> so tough, so brave, the consum- mate survivor . . .</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faced as they entered. “What happened? <NOBR>Who’s—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“Mad-Eye,”</NOBR> said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief; She had been close to</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p164 ft10"><NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> Harry knew, his favorite and his proteg´e´ at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the ﬂoor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his <NOBR>tablecloth-sized</NOBR> handkerchief.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of ﬁrewhisky and some glasses.</P>
<P class="p30 ft17">“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his want he sent twelve full classes soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. “Mad- Eye,”</P>
<P class="p275 ft2"><NOBR>“Mad-Eye,”</NOBR> they all said, and drank.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“Mad-Eye,”</NOBR> echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The ﬁrewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, ﬁlling him with some- thing that was like courage.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear.</P>
<P class="p31 ft14">“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill. “and I wondered that too, one the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they? But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you’ve for- gotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that. He didn’t want to come in the ﬁrst place, but <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> made him, and <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> went straight for them. It was enough to make any- one panic.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10"><NOBR>“You-Know-Who</NOBR> acted exactly as <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> expected him to,” sniffed Tonks, <NOBR>“Mad-Eye</NOBR> said he’s expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> ﬁrst, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . . ”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_73">


<P class="p40 ft2">73</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does it? Somebody must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zeim knowing ze date but not ze ’ole plan.”</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. the only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to save Harry’s— Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giv- ing Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. . . .</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“No,” Harry said out loud, and they all looked at him, surprised. The ﬁrewhisky seemed to have ampliﬁed his voice. “I mean . . . if somebody made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip, I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault, ” he repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. “We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again and drank some more ﬁrewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of <NOBR>Mad-eye.</NOBR> <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> had always been scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust people.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and</P>

<P class="p276 ft9">addressed Bill, “There’s work to do, I can ask Kingsley <NOBR>whether—”</NOBR> “No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”</P>
<P class="p277 ft9">“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together. <NOBR>“Mad-Eye’s</NOBR> body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”</P>
<P class="p278 ft10">“Can’t <NOBR>it—?”</NOBR> began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. “Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took it?” Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I’ve got to go to,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him.</P>
<P class="p279 ft9">“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, “What are you talking about?” “I can’t stay here.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again. It had not hurt like this for more than a year.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t <NOBR>want—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, and we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p280 ft9">She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. “If Voldemort ﬁnds out I’m <NOBR>here—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">‘Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after all we wen’ through ter get you here?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_75">


<P class="p40 ft2">75</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting himself upon his cushions.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I know <NOBR>that—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p281 ft9"><NOBR>“Mad—Eye</NOBR> wouldn’t <NOBR>want—”</NOBR> “I KNOW!” Harry bellowed.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">He felt beleaguered and blackmailed. Did they think he did not know what they had done for him, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and giver her something to eat.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">His insides clenched like a ﬁst. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his ﬁrewhisky to avoid answering.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Escaped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“It wasn’t me,” said Harry ﬂatly. “It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to, you reacted instinctively.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft12">“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling. I couldn’t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold ﬂames appear before.”</P>
<P class="p283 ft10">“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can often produce magic you’ve never dreamed of. Small children often ﬁnd, before they’re <NOBR>trained—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. His car was burning. He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort’s</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Mutter about fresh air, he set his glass down and left the room.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted independently, because Dumb- ledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Volde- mort’s. . . . But Dumbledore, like <NOBR>Mad-Eye,</NOBR> like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with ﬁrewhisky. . . .</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You told me the problem would be solved by using another’s wand!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone ﬂoor, screaming, a horrible, <NOBR>drawn-out</NOBR> scream, a scream of unen- durable agony. . . .</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p284 ft9">“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!” “I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!”</P>
<P class="p285 ft9">“I swear I did not. . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . . ” “Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . between your two wands. . . . ”</P>

<DIV id="page_77">


<P class="p40 ft2">77</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">And Harry saw the white hand raise its want and felt Voldemort’s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the ﬂoor writhe in agony—</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Harry?”</P>
<P class="p218 ft12">It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side.</P>
<P class="p286 ft9">“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered. “You aren’t still thinking of leaving?”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry’s</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">face. “You look awful!”</P>
<P class="p287 ft9">“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Ollivander. . . . ” When he had ﬁnished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled,</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">but Hermione downright terriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your <NOBR>scar—it</NOBR> wasn’t supposed to do this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection open up <NOBR>again—Dumbledore</NOBR> wanted you to close your mind!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">When he did not reply, she gripped his arm.</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wiz- arding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!”</P>

<P class="p289 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>he shock of losing <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to</P>
<P class="p290 ft10">relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to ﬁnd and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.</P>
<P class="p291 ft10">“Well, you can’t do anything about <NOBR>the”—Ron</NOBR> mouthed the word Horcruxes— “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you.

<P class="p292 ft2">“No,” Harry admitted.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She said she was saving it for when you got here.”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“The Trace’ll break on the <NOBR>thirty-ﬁrst,”</NOBR> said Harry. “That means I only need to stay here four days. Then I <NOBR>can—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p293 ft2">“Five days,” Ron corrected him ﬁrmly. “We’ve got to stay for the wedding. 79</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">They’ll kill us if we miss it.”</P>
<P class="p296 ft10">Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. “It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. “Don’t they realize how <NOBR>important—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you men- tion it, I want to talk to you about that.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off to do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin’ve both asked us as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.”</P>
<P class="p297 ft10">Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might’ve come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery of the kitchen, she started.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.</P>
<P class="p298 ft9">“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,” mumbled Harry. “Ron and Hermione</P>
<P class="p299 ft9">know about it, and they want to come too.” “What sort of ’stuff’?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I’m sorry, I <NOBR>can’t—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Well, frankly I think Arthur and I have a right to know and I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny’s. This did not help.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_81">


<P class="p40 ft2">81</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry, Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their <NOBR>choice—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p300 ft2">“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry ﬂatly. “It’s got to be me.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He handed her back the single stock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so much to do.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9"><NOBR>“No—I—of</NOBR> course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.</P>
<P class="p48 ft12">From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley keep Harry, Ron, and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of <NOBR>color-matching</NOBR> fa- vors, ribbons, and ﬂowers, of <NOBR>de-gnoming</NOBR> the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapes,´ however, Harry started to suspect her of a differ- ent motive. All the jobs she handed out seems to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the ﬁrst night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9">“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny told Harry in an un-</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">dertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.</P>
<P class="p86 ft17">“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry muttered. “Some- one else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making <NOBR>vol-au-</NOBR> vents?”</P>
<P class="p301 ft10">He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten. “So it’s true?” She said, “That’s what you’re trying to do?” <NOBR>“I—not—I</NOBR> was joking,” said Harry evasively.</P>
<P class="p38 ft14">They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the ﬁrst time that he had been alone with her since their stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquar- ters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their <NOBR>Secret-Keeper,</NOBR> each of the people to whom Dumbledore had conﬁded Grim- mauld Place’s location had become a Secret People in turn.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold much longer.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Well, <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The kitchen was so crowded that evening was difﬁcult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_83">


<P class="p68 ft2">83</P>
<P class="p302 ft9">few more people. He was trying to hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.</P>
<P class="p303 ft9">“No news about <NOBR>Mad-Eye?”</NOBR> Harry asked Bill. “Nothing,” replied Bill.</P>
<P class="p71 ft10">They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difﬁcult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about ﬁnding the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot quiet these days.”</P>
<P class="p76 ft10">“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.</P>
<P class="p71 ft10">“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?” “The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.”</P>
<P class="p78 ft10">“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.</P>
<P class="p304 ft2">“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron angrily.</P>
<P class="p305 ft10">“Of course, Ron, but people are terriﬁed.” Mr. Weasley replied, “terriﬁed that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t believe the Muggle Studies pro- fessor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his ofﬁce all day. I just hope he’s working on a plan. There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked her empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.</P>
<P class="p74 ft9">“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised,’Arry,” said Fleur, once every- one had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he looked confused. “Of</P>

<P class="p53 ft2">From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are both ﬁne with it the way it is!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young <NOBR>man—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously. “No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy <NOBR>left—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Don’t you talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley ﬁrmly, “And do as you’re told.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I can help, some of it’s my mess.” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him.</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour, you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morn- ing.”</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens,</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told Harry, block- ing his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius’s bike, and, er, I’m <NOBR>hiding—that’s</NOBR> to say, <NOBR>keeping—it</NOBR> in here. Fantastic stuff! There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the most magniﬁcent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to ﬁnd out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s <NOBR>not—I</NOBR> mean, when I’ve</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">got time.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“I’m doing it, I’m <NOBR>doing—!</NOBR> Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her ﬂuffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.</P>
<P class="p306 ft9">“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. “And how did you manage to get away?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“We were just talking about <NOBR>Mad-Eye,”</NOBR> Ron told Harry. “I reckon he might have survived.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure what he saw?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“Even if the Killing curse missed, Mad Eye still fell about a thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand.</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“He could have used a Shield <NOBR>Charm—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">For the ﬁrst time, Harry imagined <NOBR>Mad—Eye’s</NOBR> body, broken as Dumble- dore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no one’s found him,” said Ron wisely.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transﬁgured Moody and stuffed <NOBR>him—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to <NOBR>upset—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft12">But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there ﬁrst. One arm around Hermione, he ﬁshed in his jeans pocket and withdrew a <NOBR>revolting-looking</NOBR> handkerchief that he had used to clean out the over earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “Tergeo.”</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . . ” She blew her nose and hiccuped. “It’s just so <NOBR>awf-ful,</NOBR> isn’t it? <NOBR>R-right</NOBR> after Dumbledore . . . I <NOBR>j-just</NOBR> <NOBR>n-never</NOBR> imagined <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“’C-constant</NOBR> vigilance,”’ said Hermione, mopping her eyes.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from what hap- pened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft10">Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoul- ders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_87">


<P class="p40 ft2">87</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">back to his bed.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I wonder</P>
<P class="p311 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">. . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d better take it, to be safe.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p190 ft9">She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Listen,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and deﬁance.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” Harry began.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it <NOBR>with—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Listen!” said Harry again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That was decided months <NOBR>ago—years,</NOBR> really.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><NOBR>“But—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Shut up,” Ron advised him.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2"><NOBR>“—are</NOBR> you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather ﬁerce look. “I’ve been packing for days, so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difﬁcult magic, not to mention smuggling <NOBR>Mad-Eye’s</NOBR> whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose.</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s ambi- tion is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to make it more difﬁcult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about <NOBR>me—or</NOBR> you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll ﬁnd Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I <NOBR>don’t—well,</NOBR> I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arms around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproach- ing him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“I—Hermione,</NOBR> I’m <NOBR>sorry—I</NOBR> <NOBR>didn’t—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.”</P>
<P class="p313 ft10">“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron. “Go on, he needs to know!” “Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“C’mon.”</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. “Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch</P>
<P class="p314 ft10">opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, <NOBR>half-sucking,</NOBR> half, moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at him.” Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature</P>

<P class="p53 ft2">“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“no,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pus- tules.”</P>
<P class="p317 ft10">Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.</P>
<P class="p318 ft9">“He’s me, see?” said Ron. “No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to <NOBR>it—well,</NOBR> it’s hard to tell, be- cause all he can do is moan and <NOBR>drool—but</NOBR> he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Harry merely looked his confusion.</P>
<P class="p319 ft14">“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the bril- liance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again,everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.”</P>
<P class="p320 ft2">“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of</P>
<P class="p321 ft2"><NOBR>Muggle—borns</NOBR> are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too ﬁshy and they can’t all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or dad can show then the ghoul in my bed, cov-</P>

<P class="p168 ft2">“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books into one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dan- gerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not ﬁnd words important enough.</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">Through the silence came the mufﬂed sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four ﬂoors below.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the weddings.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“what we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow ﬁrst, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our priority?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,” said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to Go- dric’s Hollow. His parents graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort’s</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">91</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it happened, wanting to understand.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to ﬁnd a counterargu- ment, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought.</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">“This R.A.B. person,” he said, “You know, the one who stole the real locket?” Hermione nodded.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“He said in his note that he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can,’” Harry read out.</P>
<P class="p323 ft9">“Well, what if he did ﬁnish it off?” said Ron. “Or she.” interposed Hermione.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to ﬁnd out whether or not it’s destroyed.”</P>
<P class="p324 ft9">“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked Ron. “Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumbledore re- moved them all, but <NOBR>he—he</NOBR> didn’t destroy them.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Ron sat up straight, <NOBR>wide-eyed.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10"><NOBR>“It—it</NOBR> wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Get to the point!” said Ron.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a Summon- ing Charm. You <NOBR>know—Accio.</NOBR> And. . . they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mix- ture of admiration and incredulity.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Just after <NOBR>his—Dumbledore’s—funeral,”</NOBR> said Hermione in an even smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the Hor- cruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things <NOBR>it—it</NOBR> just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They ﬂew straight in through the open window and <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> packed them.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?”</P>
<P class="p325 ft10">“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these books anyway?” Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it</P>
<P class="p326 ft2">as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest <NOBR>Art—it’s</NOBR> a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.”</P>
<P class="p213 ft9">“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“He only approached Slughorn to ﬁnd out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux but the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the informa- tion.”</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more horrible</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p40 ft2">93</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving be- yond “usual evil.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron asked.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be excruciatingly painful.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Volde- mort attempting it somehow, can you?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails. “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly <NOBR>rare—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><NOBR>“—phoenix</NOBR> tears,” said Harry, nodding.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Exactly,” said Hermione, “Our problem is that the are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “Why can’t the bit of</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">soul in it just go and live in something else?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Harry Laughed. “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on it’s container,</P>
<P class="p327 ft2">its enchanted body, for survival, It can’t exist without it.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, ﬂushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can ﬂit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before Ron could speak.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p158 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p328 ft9">“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry. “Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . . ”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to ﬁnd out more . . . to ﬁnd out everything . . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">The silence was shattered as the bedroom door ﬂew open with a <NOBR>wall-shaking</NOBR></P>

Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her voice trem- bling. “ I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terriﬁed as she leapt on her feet, sending books ﬂying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re sorry . . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione, hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“It’s like being a <NOBR>house-elf,”</NOBR> complained Ron in an undertone, still massag- ing his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except ﬁnd Horcruxes. . . .</P>
<P class="p329 ft2">It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to ﬂatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots, though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive</P>

The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usually contingent of capering gnomes.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">He had lost track of how many security enhancements had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The ﬁrst sound of their approach was an unusu- ally <NOBR>high-pitched</NOBR> laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, <NOBR>leaf-green</NOBR> robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked <NOBR>good-natured.</NOBR> Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on <NOBR>high-heeled</NOBR> boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her ﬂustered.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trouble at all.” Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s hand between his two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at the ap- proaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.”</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. “Enchant´ee,” she said. ”Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amusing stories!” Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate</P>
<P class="p327 ft2">to the sickbed of a close friend.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said Monsieur</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_97">


<P class="p84 ft2">97</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist— length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.</P>
<P class="p160 ft11">“Well, com in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Dela- cours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and “Not at all!”s.</P>
<P class="p332 ft14">The Delacours, as it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shows “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most accom- plished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jab- bering away in rapid French.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them. “We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean against the hen- house. She looked exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re very good. Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these</P>

<P class="p176 ft12">“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t <NOBR>mean—well,</NOBR> your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p334 ft10">“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the addition strain this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be ﬁne. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p175 ft9">“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft9">“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of trouble.” “Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . . ” She looked at him, a long,</P>
<P class="p107 ft10">searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.</P>

<P class="p30 ft9">He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was the name “Gregorovitch” familiar?</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quidditch. there’s some connection, but I <NOBR>can’t—I</NOBR> can’t think what it is.”</P>
<P class="p346 ft9">“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch?” “Who?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quafﬂe drops in a season.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“No,” said Harry, “I’m deﬁnitely not think of Gorgovitch.”</P>
<P class="p347 ft9">“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.” <NOBR>“Wow—that’s</NOBR> right, I forgot! I’m seventeen.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said “Accio Glasses!” Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, or at least until they poked him in the eye.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Slick,” snorted Ron.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s possessions ﬂying</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">101</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up ﬂutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters right blue.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“I’d do your ﬂy by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a departure from tradition, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve <NOBR>Fail-Safe</NOBR> Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I wouldn’t have known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were ﬁnishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. ”He had to leave early for work, but he’ll be back for dinner. That’s our present on top.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft12">Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age.” said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the corner. “I’m afraid that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, <NOBR>but-”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her, He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them,</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">because she patted his check clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon out of the frying pan onto the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Come on, then, open Hermione’s! said Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur. (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will eve ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might ﬁnd you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. . . .”), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George.</P>
<P class="p349 ft10">Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. “I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s presents out</P>
<P class="p350 ft9">of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, <NOBR>Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft2">Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the <NOBR>ﬁrst-ﬂoor</NOBR> landing.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“Harry, will you come in here a moment?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">It was Ginny, Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow rugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.</P>
<P class="p352 ft10">He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall and a pic- ture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the <NOBR>all-witch</NOBR> Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played <NOBR>two-a-side</NOBR> Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden ﬂag on top was level with Ginny’s window.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_103">


<P class="p40 ft2">103</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy seventeenth.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Yeah. . . thanks.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difﬁcult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.</P>
<P class="p353 ft9">“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window. She ignored this. He could not blame her,</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“You didn’t have to get me anything.” She disregarded this too.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brother must have toughened her up.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">She took a step closer to him.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than ﬁrewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, <NOBR>sweet-smelling</NOBR> hair—</P>
<P class="p354 ft9">The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. “Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a ﬂat little voice,</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though i cold drain had entered the room</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">when the door appeared, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bub- ble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">He looked at Ginny wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have suc- cumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron.</P>
<P class="p355 ft9">“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. Ron marched downstairs, through the <NOBR>still-crowded</NOBR> kitchen and into the</P>
<P class="p356 ft9">yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along be- hind them looking scared.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2">Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mow lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around/”</P>
<P class="p227 ft2">“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2"><NOBR>“Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p330 ft2">But Ron held up a hand to silence her.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“She was really cut up when you ended <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted to.” “Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up</P>
<P class="p223 ft2"><NOBR>again—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us <NOBR>to—to</NOBR> end up married, <NOBR>or—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p200 ft9">“As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his . . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“If you keep groping her every chance you <NOBR>get—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_105">


<P class="p40 ft2">105</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s . . . yeah.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">Ginny did not seek another <NOBR>one-to-one</NOBR> meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George be- witched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins many jokes about it.</P>
<P class="p358 ft9">Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“Nice,” said Ron, as with one ﬁnal ﬂourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft10">“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little con- fused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would ﬁnd a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve <NOBR>Fail-Safe</NOBR> ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a con- versation with Monsieur Delacour.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“Out of the way, out of the way¡‘ sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, <NOBR>beach-ball-sized</NOBR> Snitch ﬂoating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">uneven ground. When the cake had ﬁnally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said,</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Oh, it’s nothing, dear.” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the <NOBR>thumbs-up</NOBR> and mouthed, Good one.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brow suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a <NOBR>bucket-sized</NOBR> glass of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?’</P>
<P class="p359 ft9">“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid Chortled. “All righ’, Ron, Hermione?” “We’re ﬁne,” said Hermione. “Who are you?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I’ll show yeh when yeh get <NOBR>back—”</NOBR> Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes and Hagrid rum- maged in his pocket. “Here, <NOBR>Harry—couldn’</NOBR> think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out. They’re rare, them.”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Hagrid, thanks!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a <NOBR>dustbin-lid-sized</NOBR> hand, “An’ there’s Charlie! always liked <NOBR>him—hey!</NOBR> Charlie!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, bru- tally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscly arms.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin”’</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_107">


<P class="p40 ft2">107</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Nor- berta now.”</P>
<P class="p360 ft9"><NOBR>“Wha—Norbert’s</NOBR> a girl?” “Oh yeah,” said Charlie.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“How can you tell?” asked Hermione</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">“They’re a lot more vicious.” said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum’s getting edgy.”</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. “He must have been held up <NOBR>at—oh!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came ﬂying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s voice.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Minister of Magic coming with me.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peering in as- tonishment where it had vanished.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. <NOBR>“Harry—I’m</NOBR> <NOBR>sorry—I’ll</NOBR> explain another <NOBR>time—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; the reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“The <NOBR>Minister—but</NOBR> <NOBR>why—?</NOBR> I don’t <NOBR>understand—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the <NOBR>lantern-lit</NOBR> table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table.</P>

<P class="p362 ft10">“Especially as I can see that I am gate crashing a party.” His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. “Many happy returns.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Thanks,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised, “Why us?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said Scrim- geour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use that?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here. Harry ﬂicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke,</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">“I have some questions for the three of your and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you <NOBR>two“—he</NOBR> pointed at Harry and <NOBR>Hermione—”</NOBR> can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_109">


<P class="p40 ft2">109</P>
<P class="p268 ft2">that the minister was wondering it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early.</P>
<P class="p363 ft9">“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“A surprise, apparently? You were not aware the that Dumbledore had left you anything?”</P>
<P class="p364 ft9"><NOBR>“A—all</NOBR> of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?” “Yes, all <NOBR>of—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">But Harry interrupted.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.</P>
<P class="p42 ft11">“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for Justiﬁ- able Conﬁscation gives the Ministry the power to conﬁscate the contents of a <NOBR>will—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p102 ft10">“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good in the world!” Ron laughed, Scrimgeour’s eyes ﬂickered toward him and away again as</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">Harry spoke.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t you think of a pretext to keep them?”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“No, it’ll be because the <NOBR>thirty-one</NOBR> days are up,” said Hermione at once. “They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">dangerous. Right?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Me? <NOBR>No—not</NOBR> really . . . It was always Harry who . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione to see Hermione giving him a <NOBR>stop—talking—now!</NOBR> sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron’s answer.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal be- quests. The vast majority of his <NOBR>possessions—his</NOBR> private library, his magical instruments, and other personal <NOBR>effects—were</NOBR> left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?”</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“I . . . dunno,” said Ron, “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was very fond of you.”</P>
<P class="p272 ft10">This was stretching the truth to breaking points as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parch- ment which he unrolled and read aloud.</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore’</P>
<P class="p87 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">. . Yes, here we are. . . . ’To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.”’</SPAN></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Scrimgeour took something from the bag an object that Harry had seen before. It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his ﬁngers, looking stunned.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_111">


<P class="p40 ft2">111</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s ow design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrimgeour perse- vered. “Yet the only one he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?”</P>
<P class="p365 ft9">“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do with it?” Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a mo-</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">ment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will ﬁnd it entertaining and instructive.”’</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Arts upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols.</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“But why that particular book?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “And if the Ministry still hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in <NOBR>thirty-one</NOBR> days, I doubt that I will.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difﬁcultly extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders. Scrim-</P>

<P class="p31 ft10">“’To Harry James Potter,’”he read, and Harry’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, ”’I leave the Snitch he caught in his ﬁrst Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, <NOBR>walnut-sized</NOBR> golden ball, its silver wings ﬂuttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling deﬁnite sense of anti- climax.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere ad whatever it was.”</P>
<P class="p366 ft9">“You think this is a mere symbolic keepsake, then?” “I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the win- dows towered ghostly white over the hedge.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,” Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Hermione laughed derisively.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact that Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I’m sure?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry though that an- swering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Because Snitches have ﬂesh memories,” she said.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione’s Quid- ditch knowledge negligible.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p40 ft2">113</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the ﬁrst human to lay hands upon it, in the case of disputed capture. This <NOBR>Snitch”—he</NOBR> held up the tiny golden <NOBR>ball—“will</NOBR> remem- ber your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.”</P>
<P class="p182 ft11">Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister?</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry met the minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s palm. Nothing happened. As Harry’s ﬁngers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings ﬂuttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now par- tially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.</P>
<P class="p367 ft9">“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. “That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">sofa.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now, “Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.”</P>
<P class="p368 ft10">“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling. Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. “The sword of Godric Gryfﬁndor,” he said.</P>
<P class="p369 ft9">Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the <NOBR>ruby-encrusted</NOBR> hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather</P>

<P class="p370 ft9">pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it. “So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.</P>
<P class="p173 ft10">“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryfﬁndor is an important historical artifact, and as such, <NOBR>belongs—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p175 ft9">“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting <NOBR>Hat—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p186 ft10">“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryfﬁndor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you <NOBR>think—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p187 ft9"><NOBR>“—Dumbledore</NOBR> wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.”</P>
<P class="p176 ft12">“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because Dumb- ledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryfﬁndor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy <NOBR>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-</NOBR> Named?”</P>
<P class="p231 ft10">“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your ofﬁce, trying to break open a Snitch? People are <NOBR>dying—I</NOBR> was nearly one of <NOBR>them—Voldemort</NOBR> chased me across three countries, he killed <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”</P>
<P class="p371 ft10">“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s <NOBR>T-shirt</NOBR> like a lit cigarette.</P>
<P class="p372 ft9">“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, “No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_115">


<P class="p348 ft2">115</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a <NOBR>seventeen-year-old</NOBR> boy to tell me how to do my job! It’s time you learned some respect!”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“It’s time you earned it.” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The ﬂoor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in.</P>
<P class="p373 ft9"><NOBR>“We—we</NOBR> thought we <NOBR>heard—”</NOBR> began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“—raised</NOBR> voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry’s <NOBR>T-shirt.</NOBR> He seemed to regret his loss of temper.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12"><NOBR>“It—it</NOBR> was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,” he said, look- ing Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what <NOBR>you—what</NOBR> <NOBR>Dumbledore—desired.</NOBR> We ought to be working to- gether.”</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">For the second time, he raised his right ﬁst and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies. Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only just re- leased the contents of his will.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of “Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring ﬁeld.</P>
<P class="p374 ft11">“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After everyone’s gone to bed.” Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry ﬁlled Ha- grid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, ap- parently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings ﬂutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and</P>
<P class="p321 ft2">tiptoed inside.</P>
<P class="p375 ft9">“Mufﬂiato,” she whispered, waving her hand in the direction of the stairs. “Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.</P>
<P class="p376 ft9">“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp ﬂew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“D’you think he knew the Ministry would conﬁscate his will and examine</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_117">


<P class="p40 ft2">117</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“Deﬁnitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . . ”</P>
<P class="p322 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron. “Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now ﬂicking through the The Tales of Beedle</SPAN></P>
<P class="p377 ft10">the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old <NOBR>Snitch—what</NOBR> the hell was that about?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his ﬁngers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“The Snitch I caught in my ﬁrst ever Quidditch match?” said Harry. “Don’t you remember?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing franti- cally from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“That was the one you nearly swallowed!”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were ﬁve words written in the thin, slanting handwrit- ing that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s:</P>
<P class="p378 ft2">I open at the close.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p379 ft10">He had barely read them when the words vanished again. “‘I open at the close . . . ’ What’s that supposed to mean?” Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking back.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I open at the close. . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different in- ﬂections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“And the sword,” said Ron ﬁnally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want Harry to have the sword?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “I was there it was right there on the wall of his ofﬁce during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unrespon- sive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">“And as for this book” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said Ron incredu- lously. “You’re kidding, right?”</P>
<P class="p380 ft9">“No, I’m not.” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them, then?” “Well, of course I do!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">. . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . . ”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last one?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. “You</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_119">


<P class="p40 ft2">119</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">must’ve heard of Bubbitty <NOBR>Rabbitty—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and <NOBR>‘Cinderella’—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again over the runes.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions.</P>
<P class="p381 ft9">“but I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?” Something creaked downstairs.</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,” said Ron nervously.</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.’</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper of the wedding. I’ll get the lights.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room.</P>

<P class="p383 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>hree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a</P>
<P class="p158 ft10">large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as “Cousin Barny” and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouﬂage him.</P>
<P class="p81 ft14">All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of <NOBR>white-robed</NOBR> waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were cur- rently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the mar- quee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden hairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">The supporting poles are entwined with white and gold ﬂowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butter- ﬂies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was</P>

<P class="p188 ft10">“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.”</P>
<P class="p176 ft10">“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George. “Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves— here they come, look.”</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">Brightly colored ﬁgures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic ﬂowers and bewitched birds ﬂuttered on the witches’ hats, while precious gems glittered from man of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.</P>
<P class="p101 ft10">“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, craning his neck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of <NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> witches heading the procession, he said, <NOBR>“Here—permettez-moi</NOBR> to assiter vous,” to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the <NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot.</P>
<P class="p109 ft10">“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. “Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,” she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The Ministry’s being very <NOBR>anti-werewolf</NOBR> at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.”</P>
<P class="p234 ft9">“It’s ﬁne, I understand.” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin’s face</P>

<P class="p56 ft10">fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the mag- ically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on ﬁve seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to ﬁnd Ron <NOBR>face-to-face</NOBR> with a most <NOBR>eccentric-looking</NOBR> wizard. Slightly <NOBR>cross-eyed,</NOBR> with <NOBR>shoulder-length</NOBR> white hair the texture of candyﬂoss, he wore a cap whose tas- sel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an <NOBR>eye-watering</NOBR> shade of <NOBR>egg-yolk</NOBR> yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.</P>
<P class="p282 ft10">“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry, “my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. but I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little <NOBR>gnomes—or,</NOBR> to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft9">“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but I think Fred and George taught them those.”</P>
<P class="p387 ft9">He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. “Hello, Harry!” she said.</P>
<P class="p388 ft10"><NOBR>“Er—my</NOBR> name’s Barny,” said Harry, ﬂummoxed. “Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly. “How did you <NOBR>know—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Oh, just your expression,” she said.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had ac- cessorized with a large sunﬂower in her hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">dangling from her ears.</P>
<P class="p389 ft10">Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizards farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her ﬁnger and said, “Daddy, <NOBR>look—one</NOBR> of the gnomes actually hit me!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneﬁcial!” said Mr. Love- good, seizing Luna’s outstretched ﬁnger and examining the bleeding punc- ture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today— perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in <NOBR>Mermish—do</NOBR> not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.</P>
<P class="p325 ft10">“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius to- ward their seats, “bu my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” “Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">that bite, though?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Oh, it’s ﬁne,” said Luna, sucking her ﬁnger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. “You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching her arm. Her beaky nose, <NOBR>red-trimmed</NOBR> eyes, and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a <NOBR>bad-tempered</NOBR> ﬂamingo.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">. . . and you hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?” she barked at Harry.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2"><NOBR>“No—he</NOBR> couldn’t <NOBR>come—”</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_125">


<P class="p40 ft2">125</P>
<P class="p195 ft14">“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara.” she shouted at Harry. <NOBR>“Goblin-made,</NOBR> you know, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a <NOBR>good-looking</NOBR> girl, but <NOBR>still—French.</NOBR> Well, well, ﬁnd me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the ﬁrst time there was no queue outside.</P>
<P class="p59 ft14">“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. “She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense be- cause Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her <NOBR>will—like</NOBR> they care, they’re go- ing to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. “You look great!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a ﬂoaty, lilac=colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your <NOBR>Great—Aunt</NOBR> Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her up- stairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She says, ‘Oh dear, is this the <NOBR>Muggle-born?’</NOBR> and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.”’</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’ just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died <NOBR>twenty-four</NOBR> hours later?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded George.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party.” said Fred. “He used to down an entire bottle of ﬁrewhisky, then run onto the dance ﬂoor,</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.</P>
<P class="p391 ft9">“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron. “You amaze me,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a <NOBR>dark-haired</NOBR> young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate with its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you <NOBR>were—goodness—it’s</NOBR> lovely to <NOBR>see—how</NOBR> are you again?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft11">Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, “How come you’re here?”</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show him his seat.</P>
<P class="p153 ft11">“You friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as he entered the now packed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly hair.</P>
<P class="p153 ft12">“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appear- ance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.</P>
<P class="p308 ft2">“Time to sit down, ” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.”</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_127">


<P class="p40 ft2">127</P>
<P class="p268 ft11">and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?”</P>
<P class="p392 ft2">Harry gave a noncommittal grunt.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">A sense of jittery anticipation had ﬁlled the warm tent, the general mur- muring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives: Mrs. Weasley was wear- ing a <NOBR>brand-new</NOBR> set of <NOBR>amethyst-colored</NOBR> robes with a matching hat.</P>
<P class="p59 ft12">A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf- whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden bal- loons.</P>
<P class="p286 ft2">“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swivelling around in her seat to look at the en- trance.</P>
<P class="p393 ft11">A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Mon- sieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dresses and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautiﬁed everyone it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even pret- tier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, <NOBR>tufty-haired</NOBR> wizard who had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of bill and Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls . . . ”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. they seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a <NOBR>lightning-shaped</NOBR> scar on his forehead. . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle. . . . ?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth=sized hand- kerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“ . . . then I declare you bonded for life.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The <NOBR>tufty-haired</NOBR> wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined ﬁgures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden bal- loons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells ﬂew and ﬂoated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the <NOBR>tuft-haired</NOBR> wizard. “If you would please stand up!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and sur- rounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance ﬂoor; the hovering chairs groped themselves around small <NOBR>white-clothed</NOBR> tables, which all ﬂoated gracefully back to earth around it, and the <NOBR>golden-jacketed</NOBR> hand trooped toward a podium.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and ﬁrewhisky, other totter- ing piles of tarts and sandwiches.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of <NOBR>well-wishers.</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_129">


<P class="p348 ft2">129</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a ta- ble. . . . Not there! Nowhere near <NOBR>Muriel—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Ron led the way across the empty dance ﬂoor, glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the Marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance ﬂoor ﬁrst, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the ﬂoor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance ﬂoor, where she revolved on the spot, quit alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good value.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably ﬂustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?”</P>
<P class="p394 ft10">“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,” said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione.</P>
<P class="p328 ft9">She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished to- gether into the growing throng on the dance ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p395 ft9">“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, momentarily distracted. <NOBR>“Er—sort</NOBR> of,” said Harry.</P>

<P class="p396 ft9">“Who are you?” Krum asked. “Barny Weasley.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">They shook hands.</P>
<P class="p397 ft9">“You, <NOBR>Barny—you</NOBR> know this man Lovegood vell?” “No, I only met him today. Why?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Because,” said Krum, “if he was not a guest of Fleur’s, I would duel him here and now, for vearing that ﬁlthy sign upon his chest.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Sign?” said Harry, looking at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong with it?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.”</P>
<P class="p398 ft9">“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?” “Exactly.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft11">Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he says, “Grindel- vald killed many people my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared <NOBR>Dumbledore—and</NOBR> rightly, seeing how he vos ﬁnished. But <NOBR>this”—he</NOBR> pointed a ﬁnger a <NOBR>Xenophilius—“this</NOBR> is his symbol, recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it into their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves <NOBR>impressive—until</NOBR> those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Are <NOBR>you—er—quite</NOBR> sure it’s <NOBR>Grindelwald’s—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite . . . unusual. He could easily</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">131</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head of a <NOBR>Crumple-Horned</NOBR> Snorkack or something.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“The cross section of a vot?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said Harry, who recognized the symptoms.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks ﬂew out of the end.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory came back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tourna- ment.</P>
<P class="p399 ft9">“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously. “He’s a wandmaker!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I know that,” said Krum.</P>
<P class="p400 ft9">“He made your wand! That’s why I <NOBR>thought—Quidditch—”</NOBR> Krum was looking more and more suspicious.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?”</P>
<P class="p401 ft9">“I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In <NOBR>a—a</NOBR> fan magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked molliﬁed.</P>
<P class="p387 ft9">“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said. “So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Krum looked puzzled.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gre- gorovitch vand. They are the <NOBR>best—although</NOBR> I know, of course, that you Britons</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">set much store by Ollivander.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. the holly and phoenix feather had conquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“This girl is very <NOBR>nice-looking,”</NOBR> Krum said, recalling Harry to his surround- ings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. “She is also a relative of yours?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Krum grunted.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the <NOBR>good-looking</NOBR> girls are taken?”</P>
<P class="p82 ft10">And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance ﬂoor. He wanted to ﬁnd Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the ﬂoor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizard- ing celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took ﬂight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that ﬂoated unsup- ported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with ﬂoating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Freda and George had long since disappeared</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_133">


<P class="p40 ft2">133</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ‘Odo the Hero” in a corner.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">Wandering through the crowd so as not to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock as was topped by a <NOBR>moth-eaten</NOBR> fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, the member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’ obituary.</P>
<P class="p402 ft9">Harry approached him. “May I sit down?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft2">“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather <NOBR>high-pitched,</NOBR> wheezy voice.</P>
<P class="p403 ft2">Harry leaned in.</P>
<P class="p404 ft9">“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.” Doge gasped.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I am so glad, so honored!”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">In a ﬂutter a nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. “I’ve thought o writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore . . . the</P>
<P class="p405 ft9">shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . . ” Doge’s tiny eyes ﬁlled with sudden tears.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,” said Harry. “I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. “Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count <NOBR>Aberforth—and</NOBR> somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Speaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don’t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge—</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">about Dumbledore?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Doge’s face ﬂooded with angry color.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Well, in that interview.” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved int he Dark Arts when he was young.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Dodge at once. “Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything?</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hur- ried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a <NOBR>dreadful—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p406 ft9">But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. “Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. “She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!”</P>
<P class="p407 ft9">“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just <NOBR>discussing—”</NOBR> “You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred a seven!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung around it with surprising strength and plopped her- self down upon it between Doge and Harry.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry. “Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet</P>

<P class="p56 ft10">and clicked her bony ﬁngers at a passing waiter for a replacement. she took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he came so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“Ill—informed</NOBR> sniping,” said Doge, turning <NOBR>radish-colored</NOBR> again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure you I was writing from the heart.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Muriel!” exclaimed Doge.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry’s chest.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced. “Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it! It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to ﬁnd out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!”</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“Untrue!” wheezed Doge, “Absolutely untrue!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her <NOBR>death—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel, “Why did half of</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">us never even know she existed, until they carried the cofﬁn out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!”</P>
<P class="p409 ft10">“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What is this?” Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. “Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">born, though I heard she pretended <NOBR>otherwise—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a ﬁne woman,” whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9"><NOBR>“—proud</NOBR> and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mor- tiﬁed to produce a <NOBR>Squib—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t <NOBR>exist—–“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steam- rollered on, still addressing Harry.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to in- tegrate into the Muggle community. . . much kinder than trying to ﬁnd them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle <NOBR>school—–“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her health was always too poor to permit <NOBR>her—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p166 ft10"><NOBR>“—to</NOBR> permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!” “Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know <NOBR>whether—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest conﬁdence that Ariana</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_137">


<P class="p348 ft2">137</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her ﬁngers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? Had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented?</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died ﬁrst,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have said that it was she who ﬁnished off <NOBR>Ariana—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“How can you, Muriel!” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you’re saying!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as I say, it doesn’t ﬁt, because Kendra died before <NOBR>Ariana—of</NOBR> what, nobody ever seemed <NOBR>sure—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p411 ft10">“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. “Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips, ”and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was <NOBR>heartbroken—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p214 ft9">“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’ nose halfway through the service?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">If Doge had looked horriﬁed before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“How do <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR> croaked Doge.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A <NOBR>cofﬁn-side</NOBR> brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’ fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p62 ft9">odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horriﬁed Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the <NOBR>Dumbledores—goodness</NOBR> knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would ﬁt!”</P>
<P class="p412 ft10">“Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge. “Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of Magic?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though ad- mittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a life heir. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advan- tage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!”</P>
<P class="p413 ft10">“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel “But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_139">


<P class="p40 ft2">139</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Per- cival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?”</P>
<P class="p414 ft2">“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . .</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.</P>
<P class="p59 ft14">“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to ﬁnd more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd. I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been <NOBR>arguing—“</NOBR> She dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance ﬂoor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the aston- ished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in <NOBR>mid-dance.</NOBR> Then the Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Min- istry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Ministry has fallen. Scrim- geour is dead. They are coming.”</P>

<P class="p30 ft10">Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective en- chantments around the Burrow had broken.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">As they pushed their way across the dance ﬂoor, Harry saw cloaked and masked ﬁgures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides—</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffered by terriﬁed guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know—</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as dark-</P>

<P class="p168 ft2">“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; They still seemed to be surrounded by people.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk, we need to ﬁnd somewhere for you to change.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with <NOBR>late-night</NOBR> revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A <NOBR>double-decker</NOBR> bus rumbled by and a group of merry <NOBR>pub-goers</NOBR> ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept it on me <NOBR>and—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,” said Hermione, “Just try and act naturally <NOBR>until—this</NOBR> will do.” She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . . ” said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s utter astonish- ment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and ﬁnally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“How the ruddy <NOBR>hell—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to ﬁt everything we need in here.” She gave the <NOBR>fragile-looking</NOBR> bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . .</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">143</P>
<P class="p189 ft9">Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . . ” “When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morn- ing, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his <NOBR>bundled-up</NOBR> robes. “Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“The <NOBR>others—everybody</NOBR> at the <NOBR>wedding—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft12">“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pave- ment.</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a <NOBR>bit—exposed?”</NOBR> “Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">side of the road started <NOBR>wolf-whistling</NOBR> at her. “We can hardly book rooms at</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’ home, though I think there’s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. “Look, this will do, in here!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">It was a small and shabby <NOBR>all-night</NOBR> caf. A light layer of grease lay on all the <NOBR>Formica-topped</NOBR> tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth ﬁrst and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing <NOBR>Cross—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Not to stay there, but to ﬁnd out what’s going on!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">They relapsed into a prickly silence. The <NOBR>gum-chewing</NOBR> waitress shufﬂed over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I say we ﬁnd a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.”</P>
<P class="p418 ft9">“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron. “I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve been</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">145</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuf- ﬂed off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted.</P>
<P class="p419 ft9">“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag.</P>
<P class="p153 ft14">The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shat- tered the tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, “Stupefy!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, ﬁred another at Ron: Shining black ropes ﬂew from his <NOBR>wand-tip</NOBR> and bound Ron head to <NOBR>foot—the</NOBR> waitress screamed and ran for the <NOBR>door—Harry</NOBR> sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.</P>
<P class="p52 ft10">“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Petriﬁcus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2"><NOBR>“D-difﬁndo,”</NOBR> she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Difﬁndo!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorﬁnn Rowle.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysterically. “How did they ﬁnd us? What are we going to do?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.</P>
<P class="p82 ft11">“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just now.”</P>
<P class="p420 ft9">Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. “We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better like that, it’ll</P>
<P class="p421 ft9">throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.” “You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But I’ve never</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">down a Memory Charm.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov’s fore- head and said, “Obliviate.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of the other</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf. “Why?” “Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up and</P>
<P class="p422 ft9">ﬁnd themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?” “Oh right, yeah . . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.</P>
<P class="p57 ft9">Once the cafe´ was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“But how did they ﬁnd us?” Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. “How did they know where we were?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">She turned to Harry.</P>
<P class="p269 ft9"><NOBR>“You—you</NOBR> don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?” “He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">law, you can’t put it on an adult.”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a <NOBR>seventeen-year-old?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last <NOBR>twenty-four</NOBR> hours. Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them?</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving away our <NOBR>position—“</NOBR> he began.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione ﬁrmly.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to think things through.”</P>

<P class="p423 ft10">“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. The other two gaped.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against <NOBR>him—and</NOBR> even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue “so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!”</P>
<P class="p168 ft2"><NOBR>“But—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got. Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the caf door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its <NOBR>Secret-Keeper,</NOBR> and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">As Harry closed the door behind them, the <NOBR>old-fashioned</NOBR> gas lamps sprang into life, casting ﬂickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the <NOBR>house-elf</NOBR> heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains con- cealed the portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">149</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">knocked it over again.</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. “That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured back.</P>
<P class="p424 ft9">“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry asked. “Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.</P>
<P class="p57 ft9">Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house.</P>
<P class="p425 ft9">“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward. “Severus Snape?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10"><NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, mak- ing it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, “That <NOBR>m-must</NOBR> have <NOBR>b-been</NOBR> the <NOBR>T-Tongue-Tying</NOBR> Curse <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> set up for Snape!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shad- ows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a ﬁgure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, <NOBR>dust-colored,</NOBR> and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains ﬂying open; the gray ﬁgure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its <NOBR>waist-length</NOBR> hair and beard stream- ing behind it, its face sunken, ﬂeshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly fa- miliar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9">“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill <NOBR>you—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">On the word kill, the ﬁgure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the ﬂoor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, “It’s all <NOBR>r-right. . . .</NOBR> It’s <NOBR>g-gone. . . .</NOBR> ” Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight,</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">as Mrs. Black continued to scream.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Mudbloods, ﬁlth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my <NOBR>fathers—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“That . . . that was . . . “ Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. “Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just something to scare</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">Snape.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror- ﬁgure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, <NOBR>half-expecting</NOBR> some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Nothing happened.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was that sup- posed to do?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly. “That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody here except us!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the <NOBR>corpse-ﬁgure</NOBR> had risen.</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, <NOBR>but—what’s</NOBR> up, Harry?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_151">


<P class="p40 ft2">151</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something ﬂashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you see him at my place?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No, I just felt <NOBR>anger—he’s</NOBR> really <NOBR>angry—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No, I just felt <NOBR>anger—I</NOBR> couldn’t <NOBR>tell—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I thought that connection had closed!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. <NOBR>“I-I</NOBR> think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used <NOBR>to—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly. “Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, <NOBR>remember—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had no told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the ﬂoor in front of them, where it</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">solidiﬁed into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. “Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, grip- ping his arm. “They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, <NOBR>“I—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. “It’s your family, ’course you were worried. I’d feel the same way.” He thought of Ginny. “I do feel the same way.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say “I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">He heard Ron agree. He could not ﬁght the pain much longer. He had to succumb.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the ﬂoor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by ﬁrelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the ﬂoor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter ﬁgure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">A log fell in the ﬁre: Flames reared, their light darting across a terriﬁed, pointed white <NOBR>face—with</NOBR> a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">He was <NOBR>spread-eagled</NOBR> on the cold black marble ﬂoor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up.</P>

<P class="p41 ft10">Malfoy’s gaunt, petriﬁed face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s voice rang out.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, ﬁghting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in.</P>

<P class="p202 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">H</SPAN>arry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room ﬂoor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains. It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, some-</P>
<P class="p27 ft14">where between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione’s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the ﬂoor beside him. Ron had had a ﬁt of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the ﬂoor, her ﬁngers inches from Ron’s. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely.</P>
<P class="p167 ft14">He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than <NOBR>twenty—four</NOBR> house ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the ﬂoor and he thought of the Hor- cruxes, of the daunting complex mission Dumbledore had left him. . . . Dumble- dore . . .</P>
<P class="p81 ft10">The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard</P>

<P class="p185 ft12">he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden?</P>
<P class="p334 ft10">Harry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never men- tioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dum- bledore’s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn’t Dumble- dore told him? Why hadn’t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never conﬁded in?</P>
<P class="p187 ft10">Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for com- pany. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleep- ing bad, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and started to climb the stairs by wandlight.</P>
<P class="p101 ft14">On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s <NOBR>great-great-grandfather,</NOBR> but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at Hog- warts.</P>
<P class="p186 ft10">Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_157">


<P class="p40 ft2">157</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">sockets, solid wax banging in frostlike drips. A ﬁne ﬁlm of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pic- tures that little of the walls <NOBR>silvery-gray</NOBR> silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Stick- ing Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have lone gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryfﬁndor banners, faded scarlet and hold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several posters of <NOBR>bikini-clad</NOBR> Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera.</P>
<P class="p218 ft11">With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and <NOBR>watery-eyed,</NOBR> ﬂushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the <NOBR>much-admired</NOBR> rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby- looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at ﬁnding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room.</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">Harry looked around at the ﬂoor. The sky outside was growing brightest.</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Barhilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out.</P>
<P class="p429 ft2">Dear Padfoot,</P>
<P class="p149 ft11">Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I’m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course James thought it was so funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player, but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets going.</P>
<P class="p430 ft11">We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come ﬁrst, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can <NOBR>tell—also</NOBR> Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend. I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the next about the McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard.</P>
<P class="p431 ft2">Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing with</P>

<DIV id="page_159">


<P class="p68 ft2">159</P>
<P class="p432 ft10">the most amazing stories about Dumbledore. I’m not sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to believe, actually be- cause it seems incredible that Dumbledore</P>
<P class="p433 ft10">Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless ﬁngers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down.</P>
<P class="p434 ft14">He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the ﬁrst time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her “g”s the same way he did. He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a <NOBR>half-remembered</NOBR> voice.</P>
<P class="p435 ft10">They had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric’s Hol- low . . . or else ﬂed when there was nobody left to feed it. . . Sirius had bought him his ﬁrst broomstick . . . His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak</P>
<P class="p436 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft21">. . there was something funny there . . . Harry paused, pondering his mother’s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James’s Invisibility Cloak? Harry dis- tinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P class="p437 ft9">Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down” had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time?</P>
<P class="p438 ft9">And ﬁnally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore—</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transﬁguration test, for instance or had taken up goat charming like Aber- forth. . . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Harry got to his feet and scanned the ﬂoor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">At last, lying facedown on the ﬂoor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had described in her letter. A <NOBR>black-haired</NOBR> baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the ﬁrst sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters . . . The only poten- tially useful thing he could see her was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that <NOBR>Dumbledore—what?</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Harry? Harry? Harry!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I’m here!” he called, “What’s happened?”</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. “We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly. She</P>
<P class="p439 ft10">turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him” Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several ﬂoors below. “Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_161">


<P class="p40 ft2">161</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“Harry don’t just disappear, please, we were terriﬁed! Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room. “What have you been doing?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Look what I’ve just found”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">He held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him.</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“Oh Harry . . . ”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“And there’s this too.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zoom- ing in and out of sight on the toy broom.</P>
<P class="p440 ft9">“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here” Hermione glanced around.</P>
<P class="p441 ft9">“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?” “Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Information on the Order, if it was Snape”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed. I mean was in the Order, wasn’t he?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about information on Dumbledore? The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Who?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Bathilda Bagshot, the author <NOBR>of—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents knew her? She was an incredible magic historian.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow. Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and give himself away.</P>
<P class="p31 ft14">“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared. I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, “Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had ﬁn- ished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, <NOBR>Harry—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true <NOBR>or—“</NOBR> “Harry do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman</P>
<P class="p442 ft9">like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dum- bledore!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I thought I did,” he muttered.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it?</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after a little pause. “Find something for breakfast?”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a porapous little sign, neatly lettered by hand the</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_163">


<P class="p40 ft2">163</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door.</P>
<P class="p443 ft2">Do Not Enter</P>
<P class="p444 ft2">Without the Express Permission of</P>
<P class="p445 ft2">Regulus Arcturus Black</P>
<P class="p446 ft9">Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign again. Hermione was already a ﬂight of stairs below him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. “Come back up here.”</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">“What’s the matter?”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.”</P>
<P class="p448 ft10">There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. “In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t <NOBR>see—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry. “Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to <NOBR>leave—so</NOBR> they killed him.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“That ﬁts!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!”</P>
<P class="p449 ft10">Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. “What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before <NOBR>I—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p310 ft9">He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, in which Hermione was silently pointing.</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus</P>
<P class="p329 ft2">. . . R.A.B.! The <NOBR>locket—you</NOBR> don’t <NOBR>reckon—?”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“Let’s ﬁnd out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said, “Alohamora.” There was a click, and the door swung open.</P>
<P class="p29 ft11">They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s bed- room was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difﬁdence from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bead, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, T<SPAN class="ft22">OUJOURS </SPAN>P<SPAN class="ft22">UR</SPAN>. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters . . . ”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph: a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was in- stantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“He played Seeker,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort’s press clippings.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker . . . Never mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers’ contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, <NOBR>out-of-date</NOBR> textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_165">


<P class="p40 ft2">165</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky ﬁngers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Oh, it could still be here, but under <NOBR>counter-enchantments,”</NOBR> said Hermione. “Charms to prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, remember- ing how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.</P>
<P class="p450 ft9">“How are we supposed to ﬁnd it then?” asked Ron. “We search manually,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his exami- nation of the curtains.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, ﬁnally, to conclude that the locket was not there.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy land- ing windows.</P>
<P class="p58 ft11">“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermione in a ral- lying tone as they walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. “Whether he’d manage to destroy it or not, he’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it at . . . at . . . “</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated: her eyes had even drifted out of focus.</P>
<P class="p451 ft9">“. . . at the time,” she ﬁnished in a whisper. “Something wrong?” asked Ron.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“There was a locket.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“What?” said Harry and Ron together.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we . . . we</P>
<P class="p321 ft2">. . . “</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stom- ach. He remembered. He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy . . . ”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius’s mother as they passed through the hall.</P>
<P class="p31 ft14">“Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the <NOBR>house-elf</NOBR> had once slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s No- bility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the ﬂoor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.</P>
<P class="p40 ft10">“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “Kreacher!” There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty ﬁreplace: tiny, half <NOBR>human-sized,</NOBR> his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still wearing the ﬁlthy</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_167">


<P class="p348 ft2">167</P>
<P class="p452 ft10">rag in which they had ﬁrst met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outﬁt.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed low; mut- tering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with the <NOBR>blood-traitor</NOBR> Weasley and the <NOBR>Mudblood—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I forbid you to call anyone ’blood traitor’ or ’Mudblood,”’ growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a dis- tinctively unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p453 ft10">“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?” “Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving</P>
<P class="p454 ft9">soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. “Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs,</P>
<P class="p203 ft9">“there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reac- tions to his next word.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Gone.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation ﬂoating out of him, “What do you mean, it’s gone?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">The elf shivered. He swayed.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Kreacher,” said Harry ﬁercely, “I order <NOBR>you—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. “Mundun- gus Fletcher stole it all; Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and— <NOBR>and—“</NOBR></P>

<P class="p34 ft2">then his eyes ﬂew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> the locket, Master Regulus’s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, ﬂattening him. Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay ﬂat on the cold stone ﬂoor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. “I don’t think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and <NOBR>r-ran. . . .</NOBR> “</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">“You called the locket ’Master Regulus’s,”’ said Harry. “Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!”</P>
<P class="p236 ft10">The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was mufﬂed but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen.</P>
<P class="p31 ft14">“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the <NOBR>Muggle-borns . . .</NOBR> and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . . .</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_169">


<P class="p348 ft2">169</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . . ”</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">The old elf rocked faster than ever.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“. . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.</P>
<P class="p455 ft10">“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to <NOBR>c-come</NOBR> home.” Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake . . . “</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“ . . . There was a boat . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a disposable creature, a <NOBR>house-elf . . .</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“There was a <NOBR>b-basin</NOBR> full of potion on the island. The <NOBR>D-Dark</NOBR> Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">The elf quaked from head to foot.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing . . . Kreacher’s in- sides burned . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin . . . He ﬁlled it with more potion.”</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island . . . “</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort’s white, snakelike face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes ﬁxed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its victim . . . But here, Harry’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface . . . “</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said.</P>
<P class="p456 ft9">“I <NOBR>know—but</NOBR> how did you escape the Inferi?” Kreacher did not seem to understand.</P>
<P class="p457 ft9">“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated. “I know, <NOBR>but—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disapparated!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said Harry, “other- wise <NOBR>Dumbledore—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron, “I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of <NOBR>house-elves</NOBR> far beneath his notice . . . It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“The <NOBR>house-elf’s</NOBR> highest law is his Master’s bidding,” intoned Kreacher. “Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. . . . “</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said Hermione kindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at all!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_171">


<P class="p40 ft2">171</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.</P>
<P class="p458 ft9">“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. “What did Regulus say when you told him what happened?”</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked Kreacher. “Mas- ter Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then</P>
<P class="p459 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft21">. . it was a little while later . . . Master Regulus came to ﬁnd Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. . . . “</SPAN></P>
<P class="p59 ft9">And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. . . .</P>
<P class="p257 ft10">Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cav- ern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. . . .</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“And he made you drink the poison?” said Harry, disgusted.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.</P>
<P class="p43 ft12"><NOBR>“M—Master</NOBR> Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets . . . ”</P>
<P class="p460 ft9">Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“And he <NOBR>order—Kreacher</NOBR> to <NOBR>leave—without</NOBR> him. And he told <NOBR>Kreacher—to</NOBR> go <NOBR>home—and</NOBR> never to tell my <NOBR>Mistress—what</NOBR> he had <NOBR>done—but</NOBR> to destroy— the ﬁrst locket. And he <NOBR>drank—all</NOBR> the <NOBR>potion—and</NOBR> Kreacher swapped the <NOBR>lockets—and</NOBR> watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water</P>
<P class="p461 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">. . and . . . “</SPAN></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mis- tress say?”</P>
<P class="p462 ft10">“I told you not to call her ’Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the ﬂoor “Stop <NOBR>him—stop</NOBR> him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t you see now how sick it</P>
<P class="p463 ft10">is, the way they’ve got to obey?” <NOBR>“Kreacher—stop,</NOBR> stop!” shouted Harry.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The elf lay on the ﬂoor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snot, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he was deter- mined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy it?”</P>
<P class="p123 ft11">“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had <NOBR>f-f-forbidden</NOBR> him to tell any of the <NOBR>f-f-family</NOBR> what happened in the <NOBR>c-cave . . .</NOBR> ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears ﬂowed down Hermione’s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said ﬁnally. “Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them . . . “</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_173">


<P class="p40 ft2">173</P>
<P class="p56 ft11">on the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; <NOBR>house-elves</NOBR> are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to protest, “that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he?” And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus’s family were all safest if they kept to the old <NOBR>pure-blood</NOBR> line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2"><NOBR>“Sirius—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I’m sure ’Miss Cissy’ and ’Miss Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat <NOBR>house-elves.</NOBR> Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the ﬂoor, he re- membered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s. . . .</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er. . . . please sit up.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and ﬁnd Mundungus Fletcher. We need</P>

<P class="p464 ft10">to ﬁnd out where the <NOBR>locket—where</NOBR> Master Regulus’s locket it. It’s really im- portant. We want to ﬁnish the work Master Regulus started, we want <NOBR>to—er—</NOBR> ensure that he didn’t die in vain.”</P>
<P class="p465 ft9">Kreacher dropped his ﬁsts and looked up at Harry. “Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked.</P>
<P class="p174 ft9">And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do you think you could do that for us?”</P>
<P class="p177 ft10">As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid’s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p174 ft10">“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the locket into the elf’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what <NOBR>you—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p175 ft9">“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground.</P>
<P class="p174 ft14">It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so over- come to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When ﬁnally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their ﬁrst priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.</P>

<P class="p466 ft2"><SPAN class="ft15">I</SPAN>f Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was conﬁdent that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, an da supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transﬁgura-</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">tions, did nothing to help.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they cannot see.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. “Reckon they know we’re in here?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened, “or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody’s curse?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up.</P>

<P class="p470 ft9">They know that Harry owns the house, after all.” “How do <NOBR>they—?”</NOBR> began Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood in- side number twelves. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grim- mauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept ﬂashing on and off.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Will you stop it!” she cried out on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!”</P>
<P class="p471 ft9">“Well, can’t you ﬁnd something useful to occupy yourself?” “What, like reading kids’ stories?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Dumbledore left me this book, <NOBR>Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visit- ing because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the ﬂight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.</P>
<P class="p472 ft10">Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked ﬁgure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust ﬁgure rose from the end of the hall, and rushed him, raising its dead hand.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_177">


<P class="p40 ft2">177</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">The jinx broke: The <NOBR>dust-ﬁgure</NOBR> exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind.</P>
<P class="p473 ft9">Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it. “Don’t move!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her ﬂew open and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and ﬁlth dishonoring my <NOBR>house—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hill below.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Hold your ﬁre, it’s me, Remus!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Show yourself!” he called back.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.”</P>
<P class="p474 ft10">“Oh, all right.” said Harry, lowering his wand,“but I had to check, didn’t I?” “Speaking as your <NOBR>ex-Defense</NOBR> Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quit agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower</P>
<P class="p170 ft2">your defenses.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped i a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No sign of Severus then?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“No,” said Harry, “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square <NOBR>outside—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“We <NOBR>know—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what’s happened after you left the Burrow.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the gate. A ﬁre sprang up instantly. It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butter- beers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here after the wedding?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a cafe´ on Tottenham Court Road.”</P>
<P class="p475 ft9">Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. “What?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">They explained what had happened; when they had ﬁnished, Lupin looked aghast.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“But how did they ﬁnd you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_179">


<P class="p40 ft2">179</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">dad told us the family were safe.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected Hermione.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reﬂected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s ﬁnal act had been to try to protect Harry.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lupin went on. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get to <NOBR>close—and</NOBR> then they interro- gated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.</P>
<P class="p358 ft10">“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every <NOBR>Order-connected</NOBR> house in the country. No deaths,” he added quickly, forstalling the question, “but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to ﬁnd out where you went after you visited them. They’re all <NOBR>right—shaken,</NOBR> obviously, but otherwise okay.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft10">“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?” Harry asked, remembering how effective those had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identiﬁcation or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“And are they bothering an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face ﬁlled the front page. He read the headline over it:</P>
<P class="p476 ft2">WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT</P>
<P class="p477 ft2">THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</P>
<P class="p236 ft10">Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumble- dore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments af- ter Dumbledore had fallen.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked Hermione furiously.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Lupin nodded.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“But surely people realize what’s going on?”</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“The ofﬁcial version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.”</P>
<P class="p478 ft9">“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked Ron. Lupin laughed.</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively heis the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_181">


<P class="p40 ft2">181</P>
<P class="p60 ft11">“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is not the point: They whisper. They daren’t conﬁde in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, <NOBR>you—the</NOBR> Boy Who <NOBR>Lived—were</NOBR> sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you.</P>
<P class="p479 ft9">“Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggleborns.” Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Look at page two.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10"><NOBR>“‘Muggle-born</NOBR> Register,”’ she read aloud, “‘The Ministry of Magic is under- taking a survey of <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> <NOBR>“Muggle-borns,”</NOBR> the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> <NOBR>Muggle-born</NOBR> is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> <NOBR>Muggle-born</NOBR> to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed <NOBR>Muggle-born</NOBR> Registration Com- mission.”’</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“People won’t let this happen,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It is happening, Ron,’; said Lupin. <NOBR>“Muggle-borns</NOBR> are being rounded up as we speak.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But how are they supposed to have ’stolen’ magic?” said Ron. “It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if purebloods and <NOBR>half-bloods</NOBR> swear a <NOBR>Muggle-born’s</NOBR> part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s my <NOBR>cousin—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p480 ft9">Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. “Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You won’t have a choice,” said Ron ﬁercely, gripping her hand back. “I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Hermione gave a shaky laugh.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin.</P>
<P class="p481 ft11">“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been edu- cated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye fro ma young age. And it’s also an- other way of weeding out <NOBR>Muggle-borns,</NOBR> because students must be given Blood <NOBR>Status—meaning</NOBR> that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard <NOBR>descent—before</NOBR> they are allowed to attend.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited <NOBR>eleven-year-olds</NOBR> would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_183">


<P class="p40 ft2">183</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“It’s . . . it’s . . . ” he muttered, struggling to ﬁnd words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I know.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Lupin hesitated.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I’ll understand if you can’t conﬁrm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Can you conﬁde in me what the mission is?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.</P>
<P class="p482 ft10">“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.” “I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But I ought still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly</P>
<P class="p461 ft2">what you were up to.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.</P>
<P class="p483 ft10">Hermione, however, looked puzzled. “But what about Tonks?” she asked. “What about her?” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p484 ft9">“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married: How does she feel about you going away with us?”</P>
<P class="p485 ft10">“Tonks will be perfectly safe.” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her parents’ house.” There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew,</P>
<P class="p461 ft2">was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right . . . you know</P>
<P class="p329 ft2">. . . between you <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Everything is ﬁne, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and em- barrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant. “Tonks is going to have a baby.”</P>
<P class="p486 ft10">“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione. “Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically. “Congratulations,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Lupin gave an artiﬁcial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, “So</P>
<P class="p203 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft21">. . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dum- bledore would have disapproved, he appointed my your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9"><NOBR>“Just—just</NOBR> to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said Lupin. He spoke with a ﬁnality bordering on indifference. “Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.”</P>
<P class="p266 ft9">“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bid- den to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.</P>
<P class="p487 ft9">“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last. “Explain, then,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Lupin swallowed.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9"><NOBR>“I-I</NOBR> made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_185">


<P class="p40 ft2">185</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled backward, and he glared at them so ﬁercely that Harry saw, for the ﬁrst time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">“You have only seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s pro- tection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my afﬂiction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, when parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the <NOBR>child—the</NOBR> <NOBR>child—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p367 ft9">Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. “My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of <NOBR>it—how</NOBR></P>
<P class="p270 ft12">can I forgive myself when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!”</P>
<P class="p102 ft9">“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say <NOBR>that—how</NOBR> could any child be ashamed of you?”</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“If the new regime thinks <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> are bad,” Harry said, “what will they do to a <NOBR>half-werewolf</NOBR> whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9"><NOBR>“How—how</NOBR> dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire <NOBR>for—for</NOBR> danger of personal <NOBR>glory—how</NOBR> dare you suggest such <NOBR>a—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil.” Harry said, “You fancy stepping into Sirius’s <NOBR>shoe—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who taught me to ﬁght <NOBR>dementors—a</NOBR> coward.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself ﬂying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the ﬂoor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.</P>
<P class="p488 ft9">“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione. “Don’t you start on her!” snarked Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2"><NOBR>“No—no—we</NOBR> mustn’t ﬁght!” said Hermione, launching herself between them.</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a ﬂash of green light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . .</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids <NOBR>unless—unless</NOBR> they’ve got to.”</P>
<P class="p317 ft10"><NOBR>“Harry—”</NOBR> said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the ﬁre Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that ﬁreplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other be- hind his back, communicating silently.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_187">


<P class="p40 ft2">187</P>
<P class="p489 ft10">He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other. “I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.”</P>
<P class="p490 ft9">“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once. “But he’s acting like one.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“All the same . . . ” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“I know,” said Harry. “but if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?</P>
<P class="p57 ft11">The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words, his mind was still full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a mo- ment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumble- dore’s father, Percival, was a <NOBR>good-looking</NOBR> man with eyes that seemed to twin- kle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more <NOBR>distinctive-looking.</NOBR> The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d see as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a <NOBR>high-necked</NOBR> silk gown. Albus and Aberforth were matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, <NOBR>shoulder-length</NOBR> hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but oth-</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">erwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read:</P>
<P class="p491 ft2">Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to re-</P>
<P class="p492 ft12">main in <NOBR>Mould-on-the-Wold</NOBR> after her husband Percival’s <NOBR>well-publicized</NOBR> arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to up- root the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from <NOBR>You-Know-Who.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p493 ft10">Like <NOBR>Mould-on-the-Wold,</NOBR> Godric’s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebufﬁng the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone.</P>
<P class="p494 ft2">“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome</P>
<P class="p495 ft14">her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. “The ﬁrst year they wre there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been picking Plangen- tines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a ﬁrm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.”</P>
<P class="p496 ft10">It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was signif- icant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers</P>

<DIV id="page_189">


<P class="p40 ft2">189</P>
<P class="p497 ft11">Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical abil- ity. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ar- iana’s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who deﬂected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them: “My sister is too frail for school.”</P>
<P class="p498 ft9">Next week: Albus Dumbledore at <NOBR>Hogwarts—the</NOBR> Prizes and the Pretense.</P>
<P class="p195 ft11">Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he ﬁnd out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no ﬁt state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumble- dore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">For the ﬁrst time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feat as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”</P>
<P class="p60 ft9">Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">“Expelliarmus!”</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. <NOBR>Wild-eyed,</NOBR> Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron <NOBR>rugby–tackled</NOBR> him, and Mundungus hit the stone ﬂoor with a mufﬂed crunch.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ <NOBR>’ouse-elf</NOBR> on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, <NOBR>or—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p29 ft10">“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terriﬁed. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundun- gus’s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,” croaked the elf. “Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many <NOBR>hidey-holes</NOBR> and ac- complices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.”</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed low. “Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundungus, who</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">shouted at once.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> come ﬂying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn’t wanna do <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p355 ft9">“For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,” said Hermione. “Well, you’re a bunch of bleeidin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pre-</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">tended I was up for killing <NOBR>myself—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“We’re not interested in why you ran out on <NOBR>Mad-eye,”</NOBR> said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. “We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by <NOBR>’ouse-elves?</NOBR> Or is this about them goblet again? I ain’t got none of ’em left, or you could ’ave <NOBR>’em—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,” said Harry. “Shut up and listen.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could de- mand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge</P>

<P class="p316 ft9">of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone <NOBR>cross-eyed</NOBR> trying to keep it in view.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“When you cleaned out his house of anything valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Sirius never cared about any of the <NOBR>junk—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Call ’im off, call ’im off, ’e should be locked up!” screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the <NOBR>heavy-bottomed</NOBR> pan again.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry.</P>
<P class="p500 ft9">Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. “Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Ron laughed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still ﬁxed upon Mundungus with loathing.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could ﬁnd,” Harry began again, “you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tensions and excitement too. “What did you do with it?”</P>
<P class="p501 ft9">“Why?” asked Mundungus, “Is it valuable?” “You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether he shoulder have asked more money for it.”</P>
<P class="p502 ft9">“More?” said Mundungus, “that wouldn’t have been efﬁng difﬁcult . . . bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“I was selling in Diagon Alley, and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna ﬁne me,</P>

<P class="p503 ft9">“Who was this woman?” asked Harry. “I dunno, some Ministry hag.”</P>
<P class="p504 ft9">Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. “Little woman. Bow on top of her head.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">He frowned, then added, “Looked like a toad.”</P>
<P class="p505 ft9">Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Aguamenti!” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulﬁng a spluttering and choking Mundungus.</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">Harry looked up and saw his own shock reﬂected in Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.</P>

<P class="p506 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">A</SPAN>s August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelves were never seen by</P>
<P class="p442 ft10">anybody in the surrounding houses,and nor was the number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to ﬁnd the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railing facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in the heat.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Oc- casionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.</P>

<P class="p100 ft11">On the ﬁrst day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain, for the ﬁrst time in weeks, there occurred one oft hose inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.</P>
<P class="p108 ft10">Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.</P>
<P class="p231 ft9">The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape” greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.</P>
<P class="p186 ft10">“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty <NOBR>jinx-ﬁgure</NOBR> exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs into the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you won’t like it.”</P>
<P class="p108 ft11">The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a mer- rily blazing ﬁre, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the <NOBR>house-elf</NOBR> who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a <NOBR>snowy-white</NOBR> towel, his ear hair as clean and ﬂuffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing on his thin chest.</P>
<P class="p187 ft9">“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it</P>

<P class="p316 ft9">on a hook on the wall, beside a number of <NOBR>old-fashioned</NOBR> robes that had been freshly laundered.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand, drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">A large picture of a familiar, <NOBR>hook-nosed,</NOBR> <NOBR>black-haired</NOBR> man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:</P>
<P class="p508 ft2">SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER</P>
<P class="p509 ft2">“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.</P>
<P class="p510 ft10">“‘Severus Snape, <NOBR>long-standing</NOBR> Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several stafﬁng changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrows will will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, ﬁlls the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.</P>
<P class="p511 ft10">“‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our ﬁnest Wizarding traditions and <NOBR>values—’</NOBR> Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s <NOBR>study—Merlin’s</NOBR> pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t ac- cept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top off the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends to- gether. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I can’t see that the</P>

<P class="p36 ft9">Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, ﬂipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s cook- ing had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Ron glanced at his watch.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between ﬁelds and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape’s new regime.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I remembered this,” Hermione panted.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the ﬂoor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Open- ing it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_197">


<P class="p348 ft2">197</P>
<P class="p316 ft9">was patently too large to ﬁt inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag’s capricious depths.</P>
<P class="p512 ft9">“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to ﬂit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s ofﬁce at Hogwarts: the circular tower- top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryfﬁndor.</P>
<P class="p513 ft10">“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,” Hermione explained to Ron as he resumed her seat. “But let him try now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. “So, Harry, what else happened today?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven house. No sign of her. Saw you dad, though, Ron. He looks ﬁne.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermione asked,</P>

<P class="p514 ft9">“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “But you never told us that!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she said, ﬂipping feverishly through the pages.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Well, doe sit really matter?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little <NOBR>thing—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry <NOBR>of—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. “Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?’</P>
<P class="p40 ft10">“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.” “Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now pos-</P>
<P class="p515 ft2">sessed,”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, sh e was so evil in the ﬁrst place,” Harry shrugged.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing Hermione. “We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">199</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complain- ing about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s ofﬁce is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his <NOBR>mate—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,”’ Hermione recited immedi- ately.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are because I saw that witch borrowing one from her <NOBR>friend—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“But we haven’t got any!”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“I the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were scared, he was not particularly conﬁdent himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.</P>
<P class="p171 ft11">They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisi- bility Cloak and spy on the ofﬁcial entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied on upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry.”</P>
<P class="p485 ft10">“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d settled this.” “It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a ﬁnger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dared ten days previously. “You’re on the list of <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> who didn’t present</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If ayone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a <NOBR>ten-thousand-Galleon</NOBR> price on his <NOBR>head—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry’s fore- head. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes narrow; and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,” Ron was saying. “We can’t all ﬁt under the Cloak anymore.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Master has not ﬁnished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a <NOBR>minute-er-bathroom.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the ﬁrst landing, where he dashed into the bath- room and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of <NOBR>open-mouthed</NOBR> serpents and closed his eyes. . . .</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own <NOBR>long-ﬁngered</NOBR> hand against the door. He felt a mounting excitement. . . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry’s face, humor gone, terror replacing it. . . .</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . .</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I want Gregorovitch.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He no live here! He no live here! I know him not!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_201">


<P class="p40 ft2">201</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed gliding toward her, and his <NOBR>long-ﬁngered</NOBR> hand had drawn his wand.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Where is he?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Das welfs ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a ﬂash of green light—</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“Harry! HARRY!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the ﬂoor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Harry, 9open up!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly.</P>
<P class="p516 ft9">“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with feeble bravado. “You were yelling your head off?” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Oh yeah . . . I must’ve dozed off <NOBR>or—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione, taking deep breaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you’re white as a sheet.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Fine, I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he’s probably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Harry;, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dumbledore wanted you to use Oc- clumency! He thought the connection was <NOBR>dangerous—Voldemort</NOBR> can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, <NOBR>Harry—do</NOBR> you like having this special connection or relationship or <NOBR>what—whatever—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p517 ft10">She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. “Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?” <NOBR>“I—no—I’m</NOBR> sorry, Harry, I didn’t <NOBR>mean—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“Dumbledore—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want to know why he’s after Gregorovitch.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Who?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft11">“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?”</P>
<P class="p518 ft10">“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t know.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Hermione, “but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_203">


<P class="p348 ft2">203</P>
<P class="p519 ft9">wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort’s mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?”</P>
<P class="p520 ft10">Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the ﬁrst opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.</P>
<P class="p36 ft14">They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging her presence with a ner- vous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice potion</P>
<P class="p356 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">. . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators . . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable ears . . . ”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a <NOBR>steak-and-kidney</NOBR> pie ready for them when they returned.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of <NOBR>puffy-eyed</NOBR> Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Hermione disapparated with Ron ﬁrst, then came back for Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the ﬁrst phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the ﬁrst ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o’clock.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to be here in about ﬁve minutes. When I’ve Stunned <NOBR>her—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Hermione squealed.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I nearly forgot! Stand <NOBR>back—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily grafﬁtied ﬁre door be- side them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still closed.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the alley way, “we put on the Cloak <NOBR>again—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> we wait,” Ron ﬁnished, throwing it over Hermione’s head like a blan- ket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with ﬂyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">205</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a ﬂask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s handbag.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identiﬁed their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Ofﬁce. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens,”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.</P>
<P class="p365 ft9">“Were running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.” They hurried to the close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron</P>
<P class="p377 ft10">threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, <NOBR>ferrety—looking</NOBR> wizard appeared before them.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Oh, hello, Mafalda.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you today?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the heather,” said Hermione, talking ﬁrmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street.</P>
<P class="p521 ft9">“Here, have a sweet.” “Eh? Oh, no <NOBR>thanks—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles i his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue,</P>

<P class="p522 ft9">the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps you’d better take the day off!”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9"><NOBR>“No—no!”</NOBR> He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. “I <NOBR>must—today—must</NOBR> <NOBR>go—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p200 ft9">“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go to work in this <NOBR>state—I</NOBR> think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and get them to sort you out!”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl to- ward the main street.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione.</P>
<P class="p512 ft10">At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his away back into a standing positions, he turned on the spot and van- ished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some ﬂying chunks of vomit.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the pud- dles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.”</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the <NOBR>sick-splattered</NOBR> alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several curly</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_207">


<P class="p40 ft2">207</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall, and from what he could tell from his <NOBR>well-muscled</NOBR> arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over them.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings ﬂanking two ﬂights of steps, one labeled G<SPAN class="ft24">ENTLEMEN</SPAN>, the other L<SPAN class="ft24">ADIES</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to L<SPAN class="ft25">ADIES</SPAN>. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toi- let, tiled in grimy black and white.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. “Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?”</P>
<P class="p523 ft9">The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. “Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">To Harry’s left and right came the sound of ﬂushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“We have to ﬂush ourselves in?” he whispered.</P>

<P class="p258 ft9">“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; he voice came out deep and gravelly. They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">toilet.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out a ﬁreplace into the Ministry of Magic.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had ﬁlled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden ﬂoor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this was sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of ﬁreplaces below them. Engraved in <NOBR>foot-high</NOBR> letters at the base of the statue were the words <SPAN class="ft22">MAGIC IS MIGHT</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just ﬂown out of the ﬁreplace behind him.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Out of the way, can’t <NOBR>y—oh,</NOBR> sorry, Runcorn!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.</P>
<P class="p524 ft9">“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry. “No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Oh, very funny . . . It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. “Have you seen what they’re sitting on?”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had though were deco- ratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved human: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the hand-</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p40 ft2">209</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">somely robed wizards.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come on, let’s get going.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive ﬁgure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, “Cattermole!”</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding toward them. The Min- istry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast. Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magniﬁcent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophanti- cally, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9">“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my ofﬁce, Cat- termole. It’s still raining in there.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.</P>
<P class="p525 ft9">“Raining . . . in your ofﬁce? <NOBR>That’s—that’s</NOBR> not good, is it?” Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?”</P>
<P class="p526 ft9">A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the list and bustled off. “No,” said Ron, “no, of <NOBR>course—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cat- termole. In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2"><NOBR>“I—I—”</NOBR> stammered Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, <NOBR>“—not</NOBR> that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such <NOBR>ﬁlth—and</NOBR> the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?’p’</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Yes,” whispered Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my ofﬁce is not completely dry within an hour, you wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod an unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife . . . I mean, Cattermole’s <NOBR>wife—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“We’ll come with you, we should stick <NOBR>together—”</NOBR> began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two ﬁnd Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s <NOBR>ofﬁce—but</NOBR> how do I stop it raining?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difﬁcult to ﬁx, so as an interim measure try Imper- vius to protect his <NOBR>belongings—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Say it again, <NOBR>slowly—”</NOBR> said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, “Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liason Of- ﬁce, and Pest Advisory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that ﬂuttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_211">


<P class="p348 ft2">211</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more: Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liai- son? Nice one, Albert, I’m pretty conﬁdent I’ll get his job now!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would sufﬁce. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.</P>
<P class="p527 ft10">“Level two, Department of Magical law enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Ofﬁce, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Ser- vices,” said the disembodied witch’s voice.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, “Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the whole <NOBR>thing—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them in deep conversation: a <NOBR>long-haired</NOBR> wizard wearing magniﬁcent robes of black and gold, and a squat, <NOBR>toad-like</NOBR> witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">“Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record- keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.” She consulted her clipboard. “Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee!!

<P class="p530 ft9">“Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out?” “Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s velvet <NOBR>hair-bow</NOBR> level with her shoulder.</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">214 CHAPTER 13. THE <NOBR>MUGGLE—BORN</NOBR> REGISTRATION COMMISSION</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, “Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Ah,” said Pius Thickness. “Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. “If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Good day, Minister.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden.</P>
<P class="p31 ft11">Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They ha concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected. They had not given a moment’s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court pro- ceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top ﬂoor when he knew perfectly well that has quarry had just gone down in the lift.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_215">


<P class="p40 ft2">215</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">here; the <NOBR>purple-carpeted</NOBR> corridors were as hushed as though the Mufﬂiato charm had been cast over the place.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Her ofﬁce must be up here, Harry thought.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her ofﬁce, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He there- fore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that ﬂoated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from grafﬁti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were ﬂying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern, and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watch- ing was the creation of <NOBR>pamphlets—that</NOBR> the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.</P>
<P class="p358 ft12">Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a <NOBR>carpet-mufﬂed</NOBR> footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title:</P>
<P class="p531 ft5">MUDBLOODS</P>
<P class="p532 ft9">and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful <NOBR>Pure-Blood</NOBR> Society</P>
<P class="p533 ft9">Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl.</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">216 CHAPTER 13. THE <NOBR>MUGGLE—BORN</NOBR> REGISTRATION COMMISSION</P>
<P class="p316 ft14">there was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. then the young witch beside him conﬁrmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?”</P>
<P class="p127 ft9">“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“what, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of <NOBR>pamphlet-makers;</NOBR> Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the <NOBR>wood—an</NOBR> eye that was shock- ingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.</P>
<P class="p160 ft12">For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:</P>
<P class="p534 ft27"><SPAN class="ft5">D</SPAN>OLORES <SPAN class="ft5">U</SPAN>MBRIDGE</P>
<P class="p535 ft3"><SPAN class="ft2">S</SPAN>ENIOR <SPAN class="ft2">U</SPAN>NDERSECRETARY TO THE <SPAN class="ft2">M</SPAN>INISTER</P>
<P class="p320 ft2">Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:</P>
<P class="p536 ft3"><SPAN class="ft2">H</SPAN>EAD OF THE <NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">M</SPAN>UGGLE<SPAN class="ft2">-</SPAN>BORN</NOBR></P>
<P class="p537 ft3"><SPAN class="ft2">R</SPAN>EGISTRATION <SPAN class="ft2">C</SPAN>OMMISSION</P>
<P class="p538 ft14">Harry looked back at the dozen <NOBR>pamphlet-makers:</NOBR> Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty ofﬁce opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a <NOBR>rubber-bulbed</NOBR> horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">217</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">upon the doorknob, there came a long band and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. the young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages ﬂew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s ofﬁce, and closed the door behind him.</P>
<P class="p120 ft11">He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge’s ofﬁce at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried ﬂowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with a sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a ﬂouncy, ﬂowered cloth. Behind Mad- Eye’s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft10">Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket.</P>
<P class="p182 ft10">there was a ﬁling cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch’s ﬁling cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s ﬁle.</P>
<P class="p539 ft2">He pulled it out and opened it.</P>

<P class="p543 ft10">“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he re- placed Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the ofﬁce for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words U<SPAN class="ft25">NDESIRABLE </SPAN>N<SPAN class="ft25">O</SPAN>. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.”</P>
<P class="p127 ft10">Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried ﬂowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the ofﬁce one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">Harry crossed the room and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not am mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book, Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his <NOBR>hat—The</NOBR> Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore—</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_219">


<P class="p40 ft2">219</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita skeeter, bestselling</P>
<P class="p198 ft2">author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft14">Harry opened the book at random and saw a <NOBR>full-page</NOBR> photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with <NOBR>elbow-length</NOBR> hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the ofﬁce opened.</P>
<P class="p190 ft11">If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumble- dore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf. Thicknesse ﬁnally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and begun scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the ofﬁce into the open area beyond.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">The <NOBR>pamphlet-makers</NOBR> were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimen- tal Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The ﬁrst thing to do was to ﬁnd Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in a pulled off the Invis-</P>

<P class="p316 ft9">ibility Cloak as it started its descent. to his enormous relief, when it rattle to a halt at level two, a <NOBR>soaking-wet</NOBR> and <NOBR>wild-eyed</NOBR> Ron got in.</P>
<P class="p544 ft9"><NOBR>“M-morning,”</NOBR> he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again. “Ron, it’s me, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked <NOBR>like—why</NOBR> isn’t Hermione with you?”</P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p166 ft10">But before Harry could ﬁnish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high that it resembled an anthill.</P>
<P class="p266 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">. . . I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m afraid I can- not be part </SPAN><NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for questioning today? <NOBR>Er—what’s</NOBR> happened to you? Why are you so wet?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Yaxley’s ofﬁce is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t stop it, so they’ve sent me to get <NOBR>Bernie—Pillsworth,</NOBR> I think they <NOBR>said—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p545 ft9">“Yes, a lot of ofﬁces have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley. “Did you try Meterolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Meterolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks, <NOBR>D—I</NOBR> mean, thanks, Arthur.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_221">


<P class="p40 ft2">221</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“One moment, Runcorn.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another ﬂoor, Mr. Weasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Sorry?” he said.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley ﬁercely. “You down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“I—so</NOBR> what if I did?” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr. Weasley qui- etly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Azkaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his <NOBR>friends—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p546 ft9">“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked, don’t you?” “Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your every <NOBR>move—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft12">The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. . . . the lift doors clanged shut.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining ofﬁce. When the doors opened, he stepped out into a <NOBR>torch-lit</NOBR> stone passageway quite different from the <NOBR>wood-paneled</NOBR> and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rat- tled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remem- bered on the <NOBR>left-hand</NOBR> side, which opened onto the ﬂight of stairs down to the</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p0 ft2">222 CHAPTER 13. THE <NOBR>MUGGLE—BORN</NOBR> REGISTRATION COMMISSION</P>
<P class="p316 ft14">court chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufﬁ- ciently important to get away with this, and eve if he managed it, Hermione’s <NOBR>non-reappearance</NOBR> might trigger a search before they were clear of the Min- istry. . . .</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, ﬁlling him, expanding inside him. . . .</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">Dementors, he thought.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">As he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black— hooded ﬁgures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petriﬁed <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield them- selves from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by fami- lies, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up an down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Moving through the towering black ﬁgures was terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sense him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. . . .</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_223">


<P class="p40 ft2">223</P>
<P class="p195 ft11">And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dun- geon doors on the left of the corridor was ﬂung open and screams echoed out of it.</P>
<P class="p547 ft10">“No, no, I’m a <NOBR>half-blood,</NOBR> I’m a <NOBR>half-blood,</NOBR> I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a <NOBR>well-known</NOBR> broomstick designer, look him up, I tell <NOBR>you—get</NOBR> your hands off me, get your hands <NOBR>off—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“This is your ﬁnal warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically magniﬁed so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.”</P>
<P class="p548 ft9">The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. “Take him away,” said Umbridge.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be faint- ing. They glided away down the corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“Next—Mary</NOBR> Cattermole,” called Umbridge.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her shudder.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for im- proper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as <NOBR>white-faced</NOBR> as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a <NOBR>bright-silver,</NOBR> <NOBR>long-haired</NOBR> cat prowled up</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_224">


<P class="p0 ft2">224 CHAPTER 13. THE <NOBR>MUGGLE—BORN</NOBR> REGISTRATION COMMISSION</P>
<P class="p452 ft10">and down, up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the ﬂoor be- neath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there.</P>
<P class="p549 ft9">“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge. Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?” Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears.</P>
<P class="p550 ft9">“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” Umbridge ignored her.</P>
<P class="p551 ft9">“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“They’re frightened, they think I might not come <NOBR>home—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympa- thies.”</P>
<P class="p272 ft11">Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his way care- fully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temper- ature: It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Um- bridge’s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly, and very carefully, he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Mufﬂiato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bot-</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_225">


<P class="p40 ft2">225</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">tle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying, <NOBR>“Eight-and-three-quarter</NOBR> inches, cherry, <NOBR>unicorn-hair</NOBR> core. Do you recognize that description?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?” <NOBR>“T—took?”</NOBR> sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t <NOBR>t-take</NOBR> it from anybody. I</P>
<P class="p552 ft9"><NOBR>b-bought</NOBR> it when I was eleven years old. <NOBR>It—it—it—chose</NOBR> me.” She cried harder than ever.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and some- thing gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locked.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you <NOBR>here—Mafalda,</NOBR> pass them to me.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby ﬁngers. Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, ﬁnally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s name o nit.</P>
<P class="p282 ft9"><NOBR>“That’s—that’s</NOBR> pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the rufﬂed folds of Umbridge’s blouse.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh <NOBR>yes—an</NOBR> old family heir- loom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . . Indeed, there are few pure blood families to whom I am not related. . . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, ﬂicking through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be</P>

<P class="p410 ft2">said for you. ‘Parents processions: greengrocers.”’</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the ﬂuffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of <NOBR>caution—that</NOBR> the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to holster her own <NOBR>pure-blood</NOBR> credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefy!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">There was a ﬂash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto the ﬂoor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. <NOBR>Ice-cold</NOBR> air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!”</P>
<P class="p553 ft9">Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the ﬂood. “Harry!”</P>
<P class="p554 ft9">“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her <NOBR>pretend—”</NOBR> “Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak: down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners: they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming than the cat’s protection, ﬁled the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">He ran back down the steps, stufﬁng the Invisibility Cloak back into his</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. <NOBR>“But—but</NOBR> Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Difﬁndo!” Nothing happened. “Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?”</P>
<P class="p555 ft9">“Wait, I’m trying something up <NOBR>here—”</NOBR> “Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s <NOBR>gone—I</NOBR> need to replicate <NOBR>it—Geminio!</NOBR> There . . . That should fool her. dots”</P>
<P class="p556 ft9">Hermione came running downstairs. “Let’s see. . . . Relashio!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Catter- mole looked just as frightened as before.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I don’t understand,” she whispered.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. “As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><NOBR>“Expec—Expecto</NOBR> patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing happened.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a completely be- mused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . .</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Expecto patronum!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag.</P>

<P class="p557 ft10">“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around: the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before</P>
<P class="p327 ft2">the silver creatures.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families.” Harry told the waiting <NOBR>Muggle-borns,</NOBR> who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. “Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s <NOBR>the—er—new</NOBR> ofﬁcial position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggleborns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children <NOBR>and—why</NOBR> are you so wet?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge’s ofﬁce door. I reckon we’ve got ﬁve minutes of <NOBR>that—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Harry, if we’re trapped <NOBR>here—!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Who’s got wands?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">About half of them raised their hands.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to someone</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_229">


<P class="p348 ft2">229</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Level eight,” said the cool witch’s voice, “Atrium.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from ﬁreplace to ﬁreplace, sealing them off.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going <NOBR>to—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p558 ft10">“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium: The wizards sealing the ﬁreplaces froze. “Follow me,” he whis- pered to the group of terriﬁed Muggleborns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the ﬁreplace earlier. He looked nervous.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with all the authority he could muster.</P>
<P class="p457 ft9">The group of wizard sin front of him looked at one another. “We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let <NOBR>anyone—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like me to have you family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for questioning and . . . ”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. “Purer than many of yours. I daresay Off you go,” he boomed to the <NOBR>Muggle-borns,</NOBR> who scurried forward into the ﬁreplaces and began to van- ish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful. Then:</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Mary!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, and just come running out of a lift.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><NOBR>“R-Reg?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">230 CHAPTER 13. THE <NOBR>MUGGLE—BORN</NOBR> REGISTRATION COMMISSION</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cat- termole to the other.</P>
<P class="p559 ft9"><NOBR>“Hey—what’s</NOBR> going on? What is this?” “Seal the exit! SEAL IT!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group be- side the ﬁreplaces into which all of the <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enor- mous ﬁst and punched him, sending him ﬂying through the air.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“He’s been helping <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> escape, Yaxley!” Harry shouted.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the <NOBR>still-open</NOBR> ﬁreplace, and disap- peared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My Wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?”</P>
<P class="p308 ft2">Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn in that brutish face.</P>
<P class="p317 ft10">“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the ﬁreplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubi- cle. Harry ﬂung open the door: Ron was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Reg, I don’t <NOBR>understand—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around: Yaxley had just appeared.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. . . .</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_231">


<P class="p68 ft2">231</P>
<P class="p302 ft9">and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione’s ﬁngers, which were slowly slipping away. . . .</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">And then he saw the door of number twelves, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a ﬂash of purple light. Hermione’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his hand and everything went dark again.</P>

<P class="p95 ft4">The Thief</P>
<P class="p202 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">H</SPAN>arry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green: he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath</P>
<P class="p158 ft10">into lungs that felt ﬂattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming though a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, ﬁerce creature, but saw that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest ﬂoor, apparently alone.</P>
<P class="p160 ft11">Harry’s ﬁrst thought was of the Forbidden Forrest, and for a moment, even though eh knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leaped at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns ﬂed Harry’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, <NOBR>grayish-white,</NOBR> against the</P>

<P class="p164 ft10"><NOBR>leaf-strewn</NOBR> earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“What’s happened to him?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Splinched,” said Hermione, her ﬁngers already busy at Ron’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry watched, horriﬁed, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s upper arm, where a great chunk of ﬂesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’—</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“Bag—right—’</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry sped tot he place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes—</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Quickly!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Accio Dittany!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now <NOBR>half—closed,</NOBR> strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“He’s fainted,” said Hermione who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.”</P>
<P class="p560 ft10">Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_235">


<P class="p40 ft2">235</P>
<P class="p561 ft9">been open ﬂesh. “Wow,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost too much blood already. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“How did he get hurt? I <NOBR>mean”—Harry</NOBR> shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken <NOBR>place—“why</NOBR> are we here? I thought were were going back to Grimmauld Place?”</P>
<P class="p562 ft10">Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. “Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.” “What <NOBR>d’you—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and <NOBR>then—well,</NOBR> I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!”</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at Grimmauld Place? He can’t get in there?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Harry, I think he can. <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we’re <NOBR>Secret-Keepers,</NOBR> so I’ve given him the secret, haven’t I?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft11">There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the <NOBR>house-elf</NOBR> busying himself over the <NOBR>steak-and-kidney</NOBR> pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.</P>
<P class="p414 ft2">“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">236<SPAN style="padding-left:283px;">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</SPAN></P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out <NOBR>Mad-Eye’s</NOBR> eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Umbridge had stuck it to her ofﬁce door, to spy on people. I couldn’t leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. ‘Where are we?” “In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Hermione. “I</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this <NOBR>was—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft14"><NOBR>“—the</NOBR> ﬁrst place you thought of,” Harry ﬁnished for her, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the ﬁrst place Hermione had thought <NOBR>of—how</NOBR> Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them?</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking the same.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I dunno.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said..</P>
<P class="p563 ft9">Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. “Where are we going?’ asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.</P>

<P class="p564 ft9">“Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Mufﬂiato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry . . . ”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Tent?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“In the bag!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“In the . . . of course,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He did no bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?” he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.</P>
<P class="p565 ft10">“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said Hermione, now performing complicated <NOBR>ﬁgure-of-eight</NOBR> movements with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she added, pointing her wand at the mis- shapen canvas, which in one ﬂuid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose started hands a tent peg soared, to land with a ﬁnal thud at the end of a guy rope.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Cave Imunicium,” Hermione ﬁnished with a skyward ﬂourish. “That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know they’re coming. I can’t guarantee it will keep our <NOBR>Vol—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p566 ft9">“don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. Harry and Hermione looked at each other.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, “but it feels like <NOBR>a—a</NOBR> jinx or something. Can’t we call him <NOBR>You-Know-Who—</NOBR> please?”</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“Dumbledore said fear of a <NOBR>name—”</NOBR> began Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> by his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped back. <NOBR>“Just—just</NOBR> show <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> some respect, will you?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; appar- ently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small ﬂat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the ﬁrewhisky had been on the night that <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear ﬂut- tering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his withs about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by <NOBR>Side-Along-Apparition</NOBR> and they’ll be ﬂeeing the country right now with their children. That’s what Harry told her to do.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that <NOBR>quick-witted,</NOBR> though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of us . . . ”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had wanted to ask— about whether Mrs. Cattermole’s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her <NOBR>husband—died</NOBR> in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expres- sion that Harry felt as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.</P>
<P class="p160 ft2">“so, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2"><NOBR>“Got—got</NOBR> what?” she said with a little start.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s the locket?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_239">


<P class="p348 ft2">239</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillow. “No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren’t we?” said Hermione. “Here.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron.</P>
<P class="p567 ft10">It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas roof.</P>
<P class="p568 ft9">“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. “there’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his ﬁngers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore de- stroyed it.</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft11">Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. even after all their efforts to ﬁnd it, he felt a violent urge to ﬂing the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his ﬁngers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched ﬁst.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“What d’you mean?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that</P>

<P class="p62 ft2">he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.” Harry replied, and, little though eh wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set care- fully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and <NOBR>Muggle-repelling</NOBR> charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, nothing the bats ﬂuttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.</P>
<P class="p36 ft14">He felt hungry now, and a little <NOBR>light-headed.</NOBR> Hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy: Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione’s feelings.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_241">


<P class="p68 ft2">241</P>
<P class="p302 ft9">uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease.</P>
<P class="p156 ft14">He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt half, run out of road.</P>
<P class="p69 ft14">There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare ﬂesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own.</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him, relentlessly, Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that. . . .</P>
<P class="p157 ft11">His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid he was making it hap- pen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater ev- erything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too, for these was nothing</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had already decided against try- ing to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elﬁsh Apparition from being free of the same ﬂaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione’s sleeve.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries, perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower. . .</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Give it to me, Gregorovitch.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a <NOBR>long-ﬁngered</NOBR> white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terriﬁed face, on a level with Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He had <NOBR>pure-white</NOBR> hair and a thick, bushy beard: a <NOBR>trussed-up</NOBR> Father Christmas.</P>
<P class="p569 ft9">“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!” “Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">knows.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole—</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gre- gorovitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a work- shop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell</P>

<DIV id="page_243">


<P class="p40 ft2">243</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window with a crow of laughter.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, <NOBR>tunnel-like</NOBR> pupils and Gre- gorovitch’s face was stricken with terror.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice.</P>
<P class="p570 ft17">“I do not know, I never know, a young <NOBR>man—no—please—PLEASE!”</NOBR> A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light— “Harry!”</P>
<P class="p286 ft10">He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione’s glower with a look of innocence. ‘Must’ve dozed off, sorry.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into <NOBR>Vol—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p571 ft9">“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths of the tent. “Fine,” retorted Hermione. <NOBR>“You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> mind, then!”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream! Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“If you just learned to apply Occlumency.</P>
<P class="p401 ft9">But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen.</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I <NOBR>saw—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I can ﬁnish the watch!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">Ron’s <NOBR>still-pale</NOBR> face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several minutes, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“What’s <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> doing?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whis- pered into the darkness.</P>
<P class="p572 ft10">“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.” “How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s tied up?” “I dunno. . . . I’ts weird, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said nothing about Harry’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry’s. . . .</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes still closed tight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . . ”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hustle through Gre- gorovitch’s eyes, into his memories. . . .</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he ﬁred a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> after. And I . . . I think I’ve seen him somewhere. . . .”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy’s face. The theft had happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look so familiar?</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">The noises of the surrounding woods were mufﬂed inside the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?”</P>
<P class="p573 ft9">“No . . . it must’ve been something small.” “Harry?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_245">


<P class="p40 ft2">245</P>
<P class="p489 ft9">The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. “Harry, you don’t reckon <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> after something else to turn into</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">a Horcrux?”</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly, “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be dangerous for him to make another one? didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?”</P>
<P class="p574 ft9">“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.” “Yeah . . . maybe,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">What was Voldemort trying to ﬁnd? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief?</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Harry could still see the <NOBR>blond-haired</NOBR> youth’s face; it was merry, it was wild; there was a Fred and <NOBR>George-ish</NOBR> air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . .</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">With Gregorovitch dead, it was the <NOBR>merry-faced</NOBR> thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as Ron’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.</P>

<P class="p575 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">E</SPAN>arly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and <NOBR>resilient—looking</NOBR> tree he could ﬁnd. There in its shadow he</P>
<P class="p27 ft14">buried <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that <NOBR>Mad-Eye</NOBR> would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show that they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to ﬁnd sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descend- ing mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.</P>

<P class="p81 ft10">“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when Harry ar- rived back at the tent <NOBR>empty-handed,</NOBR> out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.</P>
<P class="p578 ft9">“I couldn’t . . . make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. “Wouldn’t come.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft11">Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming ﬁlled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry’s will power to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“so we still haven’t got any food.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday ”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I don’t know.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago. Today he might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ron kicked a chair leg.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“You go and ﬁght your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry, stung. “I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“That’s convenient.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“And what’s that supposed <NOBR>to—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket! Come on,” she said impatiently, clicking her ﬁngers at him, when he did not react, “the Horcrux,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_249">


<P class="p40 ft2">249</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">Harry, you’re still wearing it!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry’s skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.</P>
<P class="p579 ft9">“Better?” asked Hermione. “Yeah, loads better!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, “you don’t think you’ve been possessed, do you?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve done while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t remember anything.’</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it at the tent.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated ﬁrmly. “If we lose it, if it gets <NOBR>stolen—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. “But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on for too long.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to ﬁnd it,” said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">In the end they settled down for the night in a far ﬂung ﬁeld belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they de- voured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?”</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, <NOBR>“’Er—my—nee,</NOBR> ’oo</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p34 ft2">worry ’oo much. ‘Elax!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument about the dementors was forgotten in the laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful as he took the ﬁrst of the three night watches.</P>
<P class="p213 ft11">This was their encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spir- its; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge noth- ing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three de- licious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts <NOBR>house-elves,</NOBR> and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coin- cided with Ron’s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.</P>
<P class="p214 ft10">“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might ﬁnd the other Hor- cruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept teching, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The or- phanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations.</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made ﬁve of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_251">


<P class="p40 ft2">251</P>
<P class="p580 ft10">said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s usually with <NOBR>Vol—”</NOBR> “Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”</P>
<P class="p581 ft10">“Fine! The snake is usually with <NOBR>You-Know-Who—happy?”</NOBR> “Not particularly.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, who made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they wouldn’t recog- nized a Horcrux straightaway.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.”</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">Hermione sighed.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p523 ft10">Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. “Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hog-</P>
<P class="p582 ft10">warts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place <NOBR>Vol—”</NOBR> “oi!”</P>
<P class="p57 ft11"><NOBR>“YOU-KNOW-WHO,</NOBR> then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If there was one place that was really important to <NOBR>You-Know-Who,</NOBR> it was Hog- warts!”</P>
<P class="p583 ft2">“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?”</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“Yeah, his school! It was his ﬁrst real home, the place that meant he was special: it meant everything to him, and even after he <NOBR>left—”</NOBR> inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">“You told us that <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">“That’s right,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and ﬁnd some- thing, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the chance to ﬁnd a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of ofﬁces.</P>
<P class="p160 ft2">“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested halfheart- edly.</P>
<P class="p317 ft11">“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had known all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble ﬂoors.</P>
<P class="p30 ft11">Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the country- side, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morn- ing they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to ﬁnd another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, <NOBR>gorse-covered</NOBR> moun- tainsides, and once a sheltered a pebbly cove. Every twelves hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, <NOBR>slow-motion</NOBR> game of <NOBR>pass-the-parcel,</NOBR> where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Hocrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.</P>
<P class="p584 ft2">“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_253">


<P class="p68 ft2">253</P>
<P class="p155 ft9">“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.”</P>
<P class="p435 ft11">And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry, <NOBR>blond-haired</NOBR> by swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.</P>
<P class="p304 ft10">As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.</P>
<P class="p585 ft14">Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the other thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors: wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, “can make good fear appear out of thin air.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray ﬁsh on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to ﬁght down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No one can. Food is one of the ﬁrst of ﬁve Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental <NOBR>Transﬁgur—’</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a ﬁsh bone out from be- tween his teeth.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got <NOBR>some—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Harry caught the ﬁsh and I did my best with it! I notice I’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I suppose!”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot back Ron. Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can ﬁnd the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. “Shut up now!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Hermione looked outraged.</P>
<P class="p586 ft9">“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the <NOBR>cook—”</NOBR> “Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_255">


<P class="p40 ft2">255</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving.</P>
<P class="p587 ft9">“You cast the Mufﬂiato charm over us, right?” he whispered to Hermione. “I did everything,” she whispered back, “Mufﬂiato, <NOBR>Muggle-Repelling</NOBR> and</P>
<P class="p270 ft9">Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">Heavy scufﬂing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around them- selves ought to be sufﬁcient, ion the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the ﬁrst time.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the <NOBR>ﬂesh-colored</NOBR> strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.</P>
<P class="p539 ft2">Within second Harry heard a weary male voice.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too early in the season? Accio Salmon!”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of ﬁsh against ﬂesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively, Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, bu they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">voice than the other.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">A ﬁre danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and ﬂames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tanta- lizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the ﬁrst man spoke again.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”</P>
<P class="p588 ft9">Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. “Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“So, you three been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a <NOBR>round-bellied,</NOBR> cheerful- faced man.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up with Griphook in the ﬁrst couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” continued the man.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Knew they were coming for me,” replied <NOBR>mellow-voiced</NOBR> Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle- born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s <NOBR>pure-blood.</NOBR> And then I meant Dean where, what, a few days ago, son?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryfﬁndor.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2"><NOBR>“Muggle-born,</NOBR> eh?” asked the ﬁrst man.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_257">


<P class="p348 ft2">257</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">Word was you’d been caught.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you’d think; I don’t think he’s quite at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">There was another pause in which the ﬁre crackled and the river rushed on. Then Ted said, “And where do you two ﬁt in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for <NOBR>You-Know-Who,</NOBR> on the whole.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“You had a false impression,” said the higher voiced of the goblins. “We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“How come you’re in hiding, then?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">‘I deemed it prudent,” said the <NOBR>deeper-voiced</NOBR> goblin. “Having refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Duties <NOBR>ill-beﬁtting</NOBR> the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a <NOBR>house-elf.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What about you, Griphook?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Similar reasons,” said the higher voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.”</P>
<P class="p589 ft9">He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. “What’s the joke?” asked Dean.</P>
<P class="p91 ft2">“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t recognize, ei- ther.”</P>
<P class="p590 ft9">There was a short pause. “I don’t get it,” said Dean.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Good <NOBR>man—goblin,</NOBR> I should say,” amended Ted hastily. “Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old <NOBR>high-security</NOBR> vaults, I suppose?”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the kid who tried to steal Gryfﬁndor’s sword out of Snape’s ofﬁce at Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">And electric current seemed to curse through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Hardly,” chortled dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s ofﬁce and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that they’d be able to use the sword on <NOBR>You-Know-Who?</NOBR> Or on Snape himself?”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days later, once he’d got the <NOBR>say-so</NOBR> from <NOBR>You-Know-Who,</NOBR> I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”</P>
<P class="p591 ft10">The goblins started to laugh again. “I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted. “It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“The sword of Gryfﬁndor!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Oh yes. It is a <NOBR>copy-an</NOBR> excellent copy, it is <NOBR>true-but</NOBR> it was <NOBR>Wizard-made.</NOBR> The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only <NOBR>goblin-made</NOBR> armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryfﬁndor</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_259">


<P class="p40 ft2">259</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft2">“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the Death Eaters this?”</P>
<P class="p363 ft9">“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged: he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an <NOBR>ex-boyfriend</NOBR> of Ginny’s too.</P>
<P class="p247 ft10">“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?” “Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook indifferently. “They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasley don’t need</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">any more of their kids injured, do they?”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said Griphook. “Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose we should</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">just be glad they’re still alive.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Course I do,” said Ted. “you’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real <NOBR>thing—The</NOBR> Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk, me in- cluded. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You’d think if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special going for him, he’d be out there now ﬁghting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against <NOBR>him—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserved to be lied to if you’re still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a ﬁsh bone. At last he</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood’s?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “you wan tot give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple- Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they’ll let you get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wiz- ard who’s against <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> ought to make helping Harry Potter their <NOBR>number-one</NOBR> priority.”</P>
<P class="p592 ft10">“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,” said Dirk. “Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achieve-</P>
<P class="p158 ft9">ment,” said Ted. “I’d take tip from him gladly; It’s what we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">There was a long pause ﬁlled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their ﬁre, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difﬁcult the longer they eaves- dropped, now found himself unable to say more than, <NOBR>“Ginny—the</NOBR> <NOBR>sword—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“I know!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Here . . . we . . . are . . . ” she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_261">


<P class="p40 ft2">261</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumble- dore’s ofﬁce,” she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!”</P>
<P class="p283 ft10">“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in the front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:</P>
<P class="p593 ft9"><NOBR>“Er—Phineas?</NOBR> Phineas Nigellus?” Nothing happened.</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?”</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Obscura!”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark eyes, caus- ing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2"><NOBR>“What—how</NOBR> <NOBR>dare—what</NOBR> are <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a necessary pre- caution!”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, aban- doning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”</P>
<P class="p594 ft10">“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus’s inter- est. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask <NOBR>you—about</NOBR> the sword of Gryfﬁndor.” “Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely <NOBR>there—”</NOBR> “Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised super-</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side. “Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved his punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blind- fold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?” asked Harry urgently.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.</P>
<P class="p325 ft10">“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbid- den Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!” He felt relieved: he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">very least.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning <NOBR>or—or</NOBR> something?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and snig- gered.</P>
<P class="p271 ft11"><NOBR>“Muggle-borns,”</NOBR> he said. <NOBR>“Goblin-made</NOBR> armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.”</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps it is time</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">for me to return to the headmaster’s ofﬁce?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">Still blindfolded, eh began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel a way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.</P>
<P class="p596 ft9">“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?” “I beg you pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Professor Dumbledore’s <NOBR>portrait—couldn’t</NOBR> you bring him along, here, into yours?”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s voice. “Evidently it is not only <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> whoa re ignorant, Potter. The por-</P>
<P class="p459 ft10">traits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot ravel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumb- ledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit!”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Phineas snorted impatiently.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I believe the last time I saw the sword of Gryfﬁndor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. “Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. <NOBR>Good-bye,</NOBR> Potter!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">And with that;, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry!” Hermione cried.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air: it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile: he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag, when she had fastened their clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.</P>
<P class="p52 ft17">“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! <NOBR>Goblin-made</NOBR> blades imbibe only that which can strengthen <NOBR>them—Harry,</NOBR> that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!”</P>
<P class="p597 ft9">“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the <NOBR>locket—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put in his <NOBR>will—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p357 ft2"><NOBR>“—so</NOBR> he made a <NOBR>copy—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p598 ft9"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> put a fake in the glass <NOBR>case—”</NOBR> <NOBR>“—and</NOBR> he left the real <NOBR>one—where?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">They gazed at each other: Harry felt the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time?</P>
<P class="p599 ft9">“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have left it?” “Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.</P>
<P class="p600 ft10">“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in there.” But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the words,” said Hermione. “Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">thought that Dumbledore had some reservations, however faint, about Snape’s</P>

<P class="p601 ft9">trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.</P>
<P class="p602 ft9">“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said. “What?”</P>
<P class="p603 ft9">Ron snorted as he started up at the underside of the upper bunk. “You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, ap- parently as nonplussed as he was.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. “Not according to you, anyway.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain.</P>
<P class="p604 ft9">“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it out, will you?” Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">himself.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to ﬁnd. Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I don’t know?” repeated Harry. “I don’t know?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier;; it pattered on the <NOBR>leaf-strewn</NOBR> bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation. Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent.</P>
<P class="p605 ft9">“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry. “Yeah, I thought I did too.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“So what part of it isn’t living up to expectations?” asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be staying in <NOBR>ﬁve-star</NOBR> hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy7 by Christmas?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We thought Dumbledore had told you want to do, we thought you had a real plan!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found on <NOBR>Horcrux—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to ﬁnding the rest of <NOBR>them—nowhere</NOBR> efﬁng near in other words?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high. “Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.”</P>
<P class="p518 ft10">“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. “D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Harry we <NOBR>weren’t—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “you said it too, you said you were disap- pointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on <NOBR>than—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I didn’t say it like <NOBR>that—Harry,</NOBR> I didn’t!” she cried.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p40 ft2">267</P>
<P class="p268 ft12">been, a <NOBR>short-lived</NOBR> ﬁrework that had ﬂared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryfﬁndor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead.</P>
<P class="p606 ft9">“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron. “Search me,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Go home then,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve- <NOBR>Faced-Worse</NOBR> Potter doesn’t care what happens to her in <NOBR>there—well,</NOBR> I do, all right, giant spider and mental <NOBR>stuff—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p607 ft9">“I was only <NOBR>saying—she</NOBR> was with the others, they were with <NOBR>Hagrid—”</NOBR> “Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, the</P>
<P class="p608 ft9">Weasleys don’t need another kid injured, did you hear that?” “Yeah, <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Not bothered what it meant, though?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about: think, Ron, Bill’s already scarred; plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he <NOBR>meant—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p282 ft11">“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the <NOBR>way—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“My parents are dead!” Harry bellowed.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“And mine could be going the same way!” yellow Ron.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.</P>

<P class="p127 ft14">“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the ﬁrst time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.</P>
<P class="p609 ft10">“What are you doing?” “What do you mean?” “Are you staying or what?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“I. . . ” She looked anguished. <NOBR>“Yes—yes,</NOBR> I’m staying, Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d <NOBR>help—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“I get it. You choose him.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Ron, <NOBR>no—please—come</NOBR> back, come back!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">She was impeded by her own Shield charm; by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the trees.</P>
<P class="p610 ft9">After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. “He’s <NOBR>g-g-gone!</NOBR> Disapparated!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.</P>
<P class="p611 ft10">Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, lis- tening to the pounding of the rain.</P>

<P class="p612 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">W</SPAN>hen Harry woke the following day it was several seconds be- fore he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, child- ishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and</P>
<P class="p613 ft10">never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron’s. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">He’s gone. Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He’s gone and he’s not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it. Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to ﬁnd them again.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no <NOBR>red-haired</NOBR> ﬁgure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her,</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but <NOBR>rain-swept</NOBR> woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, “We thought you knew what you were doing!”, and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times. Hermione seemed unable to ﬁnd any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather- covered hillside.</P>
<P class="p167 ft14">The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and walked away from him, ﬁnally sitting down on a large rock; her face on her knees,shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron’s face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was deter- mined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bring- ing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hog- warts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2">By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible loca-</P>

<P class="p68 ft2">271</P>
<P class="p617 ft10">tions of Gryfﬁndor’s sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and <NOBR>far-fetched</NOBR> their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not re- member Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide some- thing. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing. . . .</P>
<P class="p618 ft9">We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . We thought you had a real plan!</P>
<P class="p435 ft11">He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.</P>
<P class="p73 ft11">They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might ﬁll part of the gaping hole left by Ron’s departure. Despite his pre- vious assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to ﬁnd out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunt- ing kind. They relished any news about what was happening in Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the ﬁrst Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.</P>
<P class="p619 ft10">However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge’s old de-</P>

<P class="p177 ft17">From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his <NOBR>ex-girlfriend.</NOBR> In- deed as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape’s crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s regime. Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One,that there was a <NOBR>ten-thousand-Galleon</NOBR> price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slip- ping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione’s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremo- nious <NOBR>good—byes.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p620 ft10">The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, ﬂat marsh, where the tent was ﬂooded with chill water: and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow buried the tent in the night.</P>
<P class="p187 ft10">They already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought she might be more persuadable than usual on a</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_273">


<P class="p40 ft2">273</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also had the fore- sight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bank beside him.</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long, but evidently she was still de- ciphering something in it, because Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not per- suaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.</P>
<P class="p621 ft9">“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, <NOBR>and—“</NOBR> “Harry, could you help me with something?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“Look at the symbol.” She said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing around his neck?”</P>
<P class="p622 ft10">“Well, that’s what I thought too!” “Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark” She stared at him, open mouthed. “What?”</P>

<P class="p38 ft9">“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durm- strang, and Grindelwald put it there.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">She fell back into the old armchair, frowning.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“That’s very o. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in a book of children’s stories?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Yeah it is weird.” Said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert of Dark stuff”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I know . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Hmm?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I’ve been thinking. <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“Yes.” She said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think we’ll have to.”</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“Did you hear me right?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dan- gerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it’s there.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2"><NOBR>“Er—what’s</NOBR> there?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_275">


<P class="p348 ft2">275</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryfﬁndor’s <NOBR>birthplace—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p623 ft10">“Really? Gryfﬁndor came from Godric’s Hollow?” “Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the ﬁrst time in months. The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened you know, when I bought it . . . just the once . . . “</P>
<P class="p31 ft12">“Well as the village is named after him I’d have thought you might have made the connection.” Said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self that she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. “There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . . “</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, ﬁnally extracting her copy of the old school textbook. A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until ﬁnding the page she wanted.</P>
<P class="p29 ft11">“Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets at- tracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworthin Cornwald, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Con- funded Muggles. Most celebrated of these <NOBR>half-magical</NOBR> dwelling places is, per- haps, Godric’s Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryfﬁndor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the ﬁrst Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical fam- ilies, and this accounts, no doubt for the stories of haunting’s that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.”</P>
<P class="p624 ft10">“You and your parents aren’t mentioned.” Hermione said, closing the book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryfﬁndor. Gryfﬁndor’s</P>

<P class="p53 ft2">“Oh yeah . . . “</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay as his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.</P>
<P class="p625 ft9">“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually. “Who?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You know” he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s <NOBR>great-aunt.</NOBR> At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Oh.” Said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron’s name in the ofﬁng. He rushed on:</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index ﬁnger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. “Well, I <NOBR>suppose—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over, he drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing it sway through the entrance ﬂap, but there was nothing there.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do that for? Thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at <NOBR>least—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?”</P>
<P class="p626 ft10">Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely that Dumble- dore would have hidden the sword of Gryfﬁndor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_277">


<P class="p40 ft2">277</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">Harry’s dearest wish.</P>
<P class="p523 ft10">“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow?” “Yes, but we’ll have to think in through carefully, Harry.” She was sitting</P>
<P class="p459 ft10">up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better . . . “</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause,but his mind had left the conversation. For the ﬁrst time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.</P>
<P class="p172 ft12">He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have had brothers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place were it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the ﬁrst time in months, he pursued the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now.</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would ex- pect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week <NOBR>later—once</NOBR> they had surrepti- tiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invis-</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">ibility Cloak <NOBR>together—that</NOBR> Hermione agreed to make the journey.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they ﬁnally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, <NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione’s <NOBR>buttoned-up</NOBR> coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.</P>
<P class="p127 ft14">Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the night’s ﬁrst stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the centre of the village.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get rid of <NOBR>them—you</NOBR> go in front, I’ll do <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Let’s take off the Cloak.” said Harry, and when she looked frightened,“Oh, come one, we don’t look like us and there’s no one around.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Anyone of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow- burdened roofs, and their frost porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them,knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know what hap- pened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">279</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">square, was revealed to them.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the mile, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post ofﬁce, a pub and a little church whose <NOBR>stained-glass</NOBR> windows were glowing <NOBR>jewel-bright</NOBR> across the square.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">The snow here had become impacted, It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their ﬁgures brieﬂy illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church.</P>
<P class="p627 ft9">“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione. “Is it?”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. “I’m sure it is.” Said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They . . . they’ll</P>
<P class="p628 ft2">be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.”</P>
<P class="p118 ft10">Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the ﬁrst time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“Harry, look!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had trans- formed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind,pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like ﬂuffy white caps.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead. . . .</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“C’mon” said Harry, when he had looked his ﬁll they turned again toward</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry’s throat constrict. It reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a <NOBR>hand-knitted</NOBR> sweater . . .</P>
<P class="p472 ft10">There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.</P>
<P class="p52 ft12">Behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was ﬂecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wher- ever the reﬂections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket. Harry moved toward the near- est grave.</P>
<P class="p629 ft9">“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some <NOBR>long-lost</NOBR> relation of Hannah’s!” “Keep your voice down.” Hermione begged him.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Harry, here!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Hermione was two rows of tombstones away: he had to wade back to her,his heart positively banging in his chest.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Is <NOBR>it—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“No, but look!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen <NOBR>lichen-spotted</NOBR> granite, the words K<SPAN class="ft24">ENDRA </SPAN>D<SPAN class="ft24">UMBLEDORE </SPAN>and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, <SPAN class="ft24">AND </SPAN>H<SPAN class="ft24">ER </SPAN>D<SPAN class="ft24">AUGHTER </SPAN>A<SPAN class="ft24">RIANA</SPAN>. There was</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">281</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">also a quotation:</P>
<P class="p630 ft2">Where you treasure is, there will your heart be also.</P>
<P class="p631 ft9">So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumble- dore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.</P>
<P class="p190 ft14">Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will you heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“re you sure he never <NOBR>mentioned—?”</NOBR> Hermione began.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away, wish- ing he had not seen the stone. He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.” She was rubbing at a crumpling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Harry, come back a moment.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her.</P>
<P class="p632 ft9">“What?” “Look at this!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there,though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Yeah. . . it could be . . . ”</P>
<P class="p633 ft9">Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. “It says <NOBR>Ig—Ignotus,</NOBR> I think. . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott,he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard. Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away from Godric’s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went,and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had ﬁnished, that the chatter and ﬂurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry, they’re here. . . right here.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and his father this time. He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">The headstone was only two rooms behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to</P>

<P class="p638 ft2">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</P>
<P class="p631 ft9">Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . . ” A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that here?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you know . . . living be- yond death. Living after death.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft14">But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard to- gether,looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacriﬁce and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something to give to them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leaﬂess and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, ”Lets go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with mul- ticolored light, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“How are we going to ﬁnd Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. “Harry? What do you think? Harry?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2"><NOBR>“Harry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p645 ft9">“Look . . . Look at it Hermione . . . ” “I don’t . . . oh!”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the <NOBR>waist-high</NOBR> grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top ﬂoor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backﬁred. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that ﬂanked it.</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">287</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied, ”Maybe it’s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft11">He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house.</P>
<P class="p646 ft9">“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it <NOBR>might—oh,</NOBR> Harry, look!” His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the</P>
<P class="p647 ft9">ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, <NOBR>fast-growing</NOBR> ﬂower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said:</P>
<P class="p648 ft2">On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981,</P>
<P class="p649 ft2">Lily and James Potter lost their lives.</P>
<P class="p650 ft31">Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse.</P>
<P class="p651 ft9">This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence</P>
<P class="p652 ft2">that tore apart their family.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical grafﬁti, all said similar things.</P>
<P class="p653 ft1">Good luck, Harry wherever you are.</P>
<P class="p654 ft1">If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you!</P>
<P class="p655 ft1">Long live Harry Potter.</P>

<P class="p0 ft9">“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione, indignant. But Harry beamed at her.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p92 ft2">“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . . ”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">He broke off. A heavily mufﬂed ﬁgure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the ﬁgure was a woman. She was mov- ing slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shufﬂing gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a half a few yards from the and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“How does she know?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the grave- yard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them sug- gested some <NOBR>Dumbledore-ish</NOBR> power that he had never encountered before.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_289">


<P class="p40 ft2">289</P>
<P class="p656 ft9">Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. “Are you Bathilda?”</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">The mufﬂed ﬁgure nodded and beckoned again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.</P>
<P class="p48 ft11">She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house. Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken in folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensiﬁed as she unwound a <NOBR>moth-eaten</NOBR> black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Bathilda shufﬂed past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to,” said</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">Harry, ”Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ’gaga.”’</P>
<P class="p657 ft9">“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room. Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm.</P>
<P class="p658 ft11">“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candle, but it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, some- thing worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too, for she lit the candles clumsily</P>
<P class="p659 ft2">by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching ﬁre.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Let me do that,” offered Harry and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as he ﬁnished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stack of book and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.</P>
<P class="p36 ft14">The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a <NOBR>bow-fronted</NOBR> chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the ﬂame danced into life, its reﬂection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the ﬁre, he muttered ”Tergeo”; the dust vanished from the photographs, and he was at once that half a down were missing from the largest and most ornate frames.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">It was the <NOBR>golden-haired,</NOBR> <NOBR>merry-faced</NOBR> thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were in Rita’s book.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_291">


<P class="p348 ft2">291</P>
<P class="p660 ft10"><NOBR>“Mrs.—Miss—Bagshot?”</NOBR> he said, and his voice shook slightly. “Who is this?” Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">the ﬁre for her.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the ﬂames burst into life in the ﬁreplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux heat faster upon his chest.</P>
<P class="p661 ft10">“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. ”This man? Do you know him? What’s he called?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?</P>
<P class="p662 ft10">“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly. “Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. ”Who is this?”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">But she only stared at him.</P>
<P class="p663 ft9">“Why did you ask us to come with you, <NOBR>Mrs.—Miss—Bagshot?”</NOBR> asked Hermione, raising her own voice. ”Was there something you wanted to tell us?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shufﬂed a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall.</P>
<P class="p664 ft2">“You want us to leave?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">She repeated the gesture, this time pointing ﬁrstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling.</P>
<P class="p665 ft10">“Oh, right. . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.” “All right,” said Hermione, ”let’s go.”</P>
<P class="p666 ft9">But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing ﬁrst at Harry, then to herself.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“She wants me to go with her, alone.”</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p231 ft9">“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.</P>
<P class="p667 ft9">“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only me?” “Do you really think she knows who you are?”</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes ﬁxed upon his own, ”I think she does.”</P>
<P class="p668 ft9">“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.” “Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda.</P>
<P class="p241 ft10">She seemed to understand, because she shufﬂed around him toward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugged herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the <NOBR>silver-framed</NOBR> photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.</P>
<P class="p371 ft14">The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple over back- ward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and led him into a <NOBR>low-ceilinged</NOBR> bedroom.</P>
<P class="p371 ft10">It was <NOBR>pitch-black</NOBR> and smelled horrible. Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.</P>
<P class="p174 ft10">“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start; Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach.</P>
<P class="p669 ft9">“You are Potter?” she whispered. “Yes, I am.”</P>
<P class="p670 ft9">She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart. It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.</P>
<P class="p670 ft9">“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit <NOBR>wand-tip.</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_293">


<P class="p348 ft2">293</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moves; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice:</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Hold him!</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, <NOBR>foul-smelling</NOBR> room seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just happened.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much louder. “Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand</P>
<P class="p671 ft9">and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away from her.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He was it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him and he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where he neck had been.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The snake struck as he raised his wand. The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished. Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him. He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of ﬁlthy clothing—</P>
<P class="p672 ft10">He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass sur- face rained upon him as he hit the ﬂoor. From below he heard Hermione call, ”Harry?”</P>
<P class="p545 ft9">He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back. Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him into the ﬂoor and he felt it slide over him, powerful,</P>

<P class="p93 ft2">“No!” he gasped, pinned to the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p673 ft9">“Yes,” whispered the voice. ”Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . . . ” “Accio . . . Accio Wand . . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, press- ing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was ﬂooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. . .</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was ﬂying, ﬂying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral . . . .</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">He was abruptly awake in the <NOBR>sour-smelling</NOBR> darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light. It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her deﬂected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air ﬁlled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a <NOBR>pencil-like</NOBR> <NOBR>something-his</NOBR> wand-</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a ﬂash of red light, and the snake ﬂew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos; It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china ﬂew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed. The snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with pain from</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_295">


<P class="p348 ft2">295</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">his scar.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione scream, ”Confringo!” and her spell ﬂew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from ﬂoor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione one with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">And then his sear burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl’s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry pain . . . that it could happen here, where it had happened before . . . here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die . . . to die . . . .</P>
<P class="p158 ft10">The pain was so terrible . . . ripped from his body . . . . But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how could he feel so unbearably, didn’t pain cease with death, didn’t it go—</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop window covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Mug- gle trapping of a world in which they did not believe . . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions . . . . Not anger . . . . that was for weaker souls than he</P>
<P class="p154 ft2">. . . but triumph, yes . . . . He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . .</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Nice costume, mister!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face. Then the child turned and ran away. . . . Beneath the robe be ﬁngered the hand of his wand. . . One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother. . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .</P>

<P class="p674 ft10">And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and peered over it. . . . They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black— haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small <NOBR>black-haired</NOBR> boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small ﬁst. . . .</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear, her long <NOBR>dark-red</NOBR> hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . .</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did no hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand. . .</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Hold him off, without a wand in his hand? . . . . He laughed before casting the curse. . . .</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Avada Kedavra!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The green light ﬁlled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . .</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He could hear her screaming from the upper ﬂoor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear. . . . He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand either. . . . How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . .</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand. . . and there she stood, the child in her arms.</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">297</P>
<P class="p675 ft10">At the last sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . .</P>

<P class="p45 ft9">He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to ﬁnish them all. . . .</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">The green light ﬂashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty light, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing—</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face. He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry. It had seen that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage—</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Avada Kedavra!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">And then he broke; He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away. . . far away. . .</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“No,” he moaned.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">The snake rustled on the ﬁlthy, cluttered ﬂoor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy. . .</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No. . . ”</P>

<P class="p677 ft9">“No. . . I dropped it. . . I dropped it. . . ” “Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">He was Harry. . . Harry, not Voldemort. . . and the thing that was rustling was not a snake. . . He opened his eyes.</P>
<P class="p678 ft9">“Harry,” Hermione whispered. ”Do you feel <NOBR>all—all</NOBR> right?” “Yes,” he lied.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blan- kets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold, ﬂat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“We got away.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Yes,” said Hermione, ”I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been. . . Well, you haven’t been quite. . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand. She had been wiping his face.</P>
<P class="p679 ft9">“You’ve been ill,” she ﬁnished, ”Quite ill.” “How long ago did we leave?”</P>
<P class="p680 ft9">“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.” “And I’ve been. . . what, unconscious?”</P>
<P class="p681 ft10">“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortable, ”You’ve been shouting and moan- ing and. . . things,” she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib?</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the subject. ”It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too,</P>

<P class="p42 ft10">He pulled the sweaty <NOBR>T-shirt</NOBR> he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the <NOBR>half-healed</NOBR> puncture marks to his forearm.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">He lay back on his pillow and looked into her pinched gray face.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“It’s not your fault, I wanted to go too, I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Yeah, well. . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?”</P>
<P class="p682 ft9">“No,” he said. ”She was the snake. . . or the snake was her. . . all along.” <NOBR>“W—what?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him. It made the whole thing horribly vivid.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was. . . was inside her. You- <NOBR>Know-Who</NOBR> put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I’d go back.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“The snake was inside her?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">He opened his eyes again. Hermione looked revolted, nauseated. “Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said, ”She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. One we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to <NOBR>You-Know-Who.</NOBR> I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there. . . and then. . . .”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck; Hermione did not need to know the details.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">He looked down at the puncture marks.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> came.” If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of</P>
<P class="p683 ft9">it. . . Sick at heart, he sat up threw back the covers. “Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I’m ﬁne. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?”</P>
<P class="p684 ft9">She did not answer, she merely looked at him. “Where’s my wand, Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p685 ft9">She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. “Harry. . . ”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Where’s my wand?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think properly. Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Mend it. Please.”</P>
<P class="p686 ft9">“Harry, I don’t think, when its broken like <NOBR>this—”</NOBR> “Please, Hermione, try!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><NOBR>“R-Reparo.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p687 ft9">The handling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up. “Lumos!”</P>
<P class="p688 ft9">The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione. “Expelliarmus!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Hermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing. . . the wand that had survived so much. . .</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I’m so, so</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">301</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must <NOBR>have—must</NOBR> have <NOBR>hit—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. <NOBR>”We’ll—we’ll</NOBR> ﬁnd a way to repair it.”</P>
<P class="p482 ft10">“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. ”Remember. . . remember Ron? When he broke his want, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new one.” Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to ﬁnd himself a new wand? “Well,” he said, in a falsely <NOBR>matter-of-fact</NOBR> voice, ”well, I’ll just borrow yours</P>
<P class="p689 ft2">for now, then. While I keep watch.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.</P>

He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence.</P>
<P class="p167 ft11">Without realizing it, he was digging his ﬁngers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different.

<P class="p29 ft10">He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the moleskin and for a moment he had to ﬁght the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind—</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him in- side, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held answers, convinced them- selves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dum- bledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and <NOBR>undreamed-of</NOBR> terrors, alone and unaided. Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for Volde- mort to ﬁnd out who he was. . . . Voldemort had all the information now. . . .</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Harry?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm.</P>
<P class="p692 ft9">“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups. “Do you mind if I talk to you?”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I’ve got the book.”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“Where—how—?”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p308 ft9">“It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Hermione read the few lines of spiky, <NOBR>acid-green</NOBR> writing aloud,</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Dear Batty, Thanks for the help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it, Rita. I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any ﬁt state to read it?”</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“No, she probably wasn’t.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a surge of sav- age pleasure: Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it was worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He rifﬂed through the pages, looking for photographs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some <NOBR>long-forgotten</NOBR> joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption:</P>
<P class="p693 ft1">Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death</P>
<P class="p694 ft1">with his friend Gellert Grindelwald.</P>
<P class="p82 ft12">Harry gasped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. he looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contem- plating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Grindelwald?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around</P>

<P class="p331 ft10">them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greed- ily, but became lost: It was necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to read:</P>
<P class="p695 ft14">Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hog- warts in a blaze of <NOBR>glory—Head</NOBR> Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional <NOBR>Spell-Casting,</NOBR> British Youth Repre- sentative to the Wizengamot, Gold <NOBR>Medal-Winner</NOBR> for <NOBR>Ground-Breaking</NOBR> Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias “Dog- breath” Doge, the <NOBR>dim-witted</NOBR> but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school.</P>
<P class="p430 ft10">The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in Lon- don, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s death. “Dog- breath” Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore’s deci- sion to give up his expedition as an act of noble <NOBR>self-sacriﬁce.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p696 ft10">Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, sup- posedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?</P>
<P class="p126 ft10">“he were a head case, that Aberforth,” said Enid Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that time. “Rand wild, ’Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don’t think Albus was fussed about him, I never saw them together, anyway.”</P>
<P class="p697 ft10">So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For, though her ﬁrst jailer had died, there was no change in</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_307">


<P class="p68 ft2">307</P>
<P class="p698 ft11">the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence con- tinued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like “Dogbreath” Doge could be counted upon to believe in the story of her “ill health.” Another such easily satisﬁed friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric’s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she ﬁrst attempted to welcome the family to the village. Sev- eral years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hog- warts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on <NOBR>trans-species</NOBR> transformation in Transﬁguration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra’s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric’s Hollow</P>
<P class="p699 ft9">who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore’s mother. Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in</P>
<P class="p700 ft10">her life has now dimmed. “The ﬁre’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Nevertheless, a combination of <NOBR>tried-and-tested</NOBR> reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story.</P>
<P class="p701 ft11">Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra’s pre- mature death down to a backﬁring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her “frail” and “delicate.” On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put in procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the <NOBR>best-kept</NOBR> story of Al- bus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed for the ﬁrst time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppres- sion of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family.</P>

<P class="p107 ft2">agreed to accept into her home her <NOBR>great-nephew,</NOBR> Gellert Grindel- wald.</P>
<P class="p703 ft14">The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dan- gerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here.</P>
<P class="p234 ft14">Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its un- fortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than chan- nel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was ex- pelled.</P>
<P class="p109 ft14">Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald’s next move- ments is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his <NOBR>great-aunt</NOBR> in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Al- bus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p187 ft10">“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda, “whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.”</P>
<P class="p100 ft9">They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore send Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night.</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in <NOBR>discussion—both</NOBR> such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on <NOBR>ﬁre—I’d</NOBR> some- times hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom window, delivering a</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">309</P>
<P class="p704 ft9">letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and then he had to let Gellert know immediately!”</P>
<P class="p705 ft10">And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore’s fans will ﬁnd it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen- <NOBR>year-old</NOBR> hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the origi- nal letter may be seen on page 463.)</P>
<P class="p706 ft2">Gellert—</P>
<P class="p707 ft11">Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES’ OWN <NOBR>GOOD—this,</NOBR> I think is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives up the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the founda- tion stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counter- arguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)</P>
<P class="p708 ft2">Albus</P>
<P class="p709 ft11">Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of over- throwing the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dum- bledore as the <NOBR>Muggle-borns’</NOBR> greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister!</P>

<P class="p710 ft10">No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking.</P>
<P class="p711 ft10">Barely two months into their great new friendship. Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary dual (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no.</P>
<P class="p233 ft10">“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says Bathilda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him.</P>
<P class="p712 ft11">“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. But Aber- forth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus’s nose t the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons ﬁghting like that, across her daughter’s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p713 ft11">This dreadful <NOBR>cofﬁn-side</NOBR> brawl, known only to those few who at- tended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister’s death? Was it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, ex- pelled from Durmstrang for <NOBR>near-fatal</NOBR> attacks upon fellow students, ﬂed the country hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas</P>

<P class="p117 ft2">of the Wizarding world.</P>
<P class="p714 ft10">Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seem to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some ﬁve years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Grindelwald. Was it a lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluc- tantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?</P>
<P class="p715 ft10">And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the ﬁrst person to die “for the greater good”?</P>
<P class="p716 ft10">The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry’s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2"><NOBR>“Harry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p59 ft14">But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, be- lieved him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . “Harry.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts. “Listen to me. <NOBR>It—it</NOBR> doesn’t make very nice <NOBR>reading—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p121 ft2">“Yeah, you could say <NOBR>that—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p717 ft10"><NOBR>“—but</NOBR> don’t forget, Harry this is Rita Skeeter writing.” “You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?”</P>
<P class="p718 ft9">“Yes, <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. “I think that’s the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk,</P>

<P class="p331 ft10">bur ’For the Greater Godd’ became Grindelwald’s slogan, his justiﬁcation for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ’For the Greater Godd’ was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“What’s Nurmengard?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, <NOBR>it’s—it’s</NOBR> an awful though that Dumbledore’s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power But on the other hand, even Rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. “I thought you ’d say ’They were young.’ They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to ﬁght the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I’m not truing to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermione. “All that ’right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ’Magic Is Might’ all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the <NOBR>house—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was keeping locked <NOBR>up—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we know would never, ever have <NOBR>allowed—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer Muggles by force!” Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he did believe those things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to ﬁghting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped</P>

<P class="p41 ft10">Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights, who fought <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dum- bledore smiled dolefully at both.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that Dumb- ledore never told you any of this himself.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he ﬂung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!”</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">his voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insigniﬁcant s insects beneath that wide sky.</P>
<P class="p719 ft9">“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.” Harry dropped his arms.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.”</P>
<P class="p57 ft9">Harry picked up Hermione’s wand, which he dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance to the tent.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Thanks for the tea. I’ll ﬁnish the watch. You get back in the warm.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft12">She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared.</P>

<P class="p25 ft4">The Silver Doe</P>
<P class="p720 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">I</SPAN>t was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, ﬁrst through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of</P>
<P class="p203 ft10">Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping arund the tent was footsteps or voices.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of the wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside, I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we ought to Diapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry was wearing the Horcrux,</P>

<P class="p464 ft10">and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Diapparated. The usual tight- ness engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.</P>
<P class="p233 ft9">“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging at tent poles.</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “‘I camp camping here once with my mum and dad.”</P>
<P class="p186 ft11">Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue ﬂames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness; an impression reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousless. That afternnon fresh ﬂakes drifted down upon then, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.</P>
<P class="p176 ft10">After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.</P>
<P class="p100 ft14">Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. he was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Chrostmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.</P>
<P class="p109 ft10">Every tiny movement seemed magniﬁed in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all re- main stil and silent so that he could sparate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. He re- membered the sound of a cloak slithering ove rdead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their</P>

<P class="p302 ft9">protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">Several time he jerked upright, he neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his ﬁngers when it happened.</P>
<P class="p619 ft10">A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him.</P>
<P class="p76 ft10">He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it <NOBR>pitch-black</NOBR> in silhouette, and still the thing came closer. . . .</P>
<P class="p722 ft10">And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a <NOBR>silver-white</NOBR> doe, <NOBR>moon-bright</NOBR> and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the ﬁne powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, <NOBR>long-lashed</NOBR> eyes held high.</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">Harry stared at the creature, ﬁlled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until that moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impules to shout for Hermione, which had been so string a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone.</P>
<P class="p585 ft9">They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned an walked away.</P>
<P class="p191 ft9">“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come back!” She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her bright-</P>
<P class="p723 ft12">ness was striped by their think black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him , and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he low- ered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came; Her presence had meant safety.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Lumos!” he whispered, and the <NOBR>wand-tip</NOBR> ignited.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wan- dlight, watching him?</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out him, no ﬂash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittereing as he raised the wand higher to examine it.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reﬂected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross . . .</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to ﬂood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryfﬁndor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could</P>

<P class="p302 ft14">it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhileration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.</P>
<P class="p191 ft9">He pointed the want at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio Sword.” It did not stir. He had not expected it to. IF it had been that easy, the sword</P>
<P class="p724 ft12">would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.</P>
<P class="p725 ft9">“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indif- ferent, motionless.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryfﬁndor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that deﬁned a Gryfﬁndor? A small voice inside Harry’s head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryfﬁndors apart.</P>
<P class="p78 ft10">Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">He glanced at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced that noobdy was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">uninviting.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">With fumbling ﬁngeres Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip of until at last he stood there in is underwear, bearfooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of Sirius’s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione’s wand at the ice.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“Difﬁndo.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the rufﬂed water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely.</P>
<P class="p726 ft10">Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much coulder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Every pore of his body screamed in protest; The very air in his lungs seems to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently, the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blad with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasp- ing and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived.</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">The cold was agony: It attacked him like ﬁre. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His ﬁngers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_321">


<P class="p40 ft2">321</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Then something closed tight around his neck. He though of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push humself back to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen ﬁngers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death’s. . . .</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked. . . . Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps. . . .</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his ﬂesh. It was gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head,</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“Are—you—mental?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p59 ft12">Nothing but the shock of hearning that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed bud drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryfﬁndor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“What the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung back- ward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron’s reappearance: he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and began to pull them on.</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool; he had saved Harry’s life.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“It was <NOBR>y—you?”</NOBR> Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his <NOBR>near-strangulation.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p727 ft10">“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused. <NOBR>“Y—you</NOBR> cast that doe?”</P>
<P class="p728 ft10">“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!” “My Patronus is a stag.”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a ﬁnal sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“How come you’re here?”</P>
<P class="p569 ft10">Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. “Well, <NOBR>I’ve—you</NOBR> <NOBR>know—I’ve</NOBR> come back. <NOBR>If—”</NOBR> He cleared his throat. “You</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">know. You still want me.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry’s life.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Ron lookded down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in, right?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get here? How did you ﬁnd us?”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following.”</P>
<P class="p729 ft10">“You didn’t see anyone else?” “No,” said Ron, <NOBR>“I—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p171 ft10">“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour <NOBR>to—hey!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew together: there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, and ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.</P>
<P class="p730 ft9">“Anything there?” Ron asked. “No,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p731 ft9">“So how did the sword ever get into that pool?” “Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermione’s wand.</P>
<P class="p732 ft9">“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron. “One way to ﬁnd out, isn’t there?” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the ting inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him pos- sess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to desktroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a ﬂattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“No, you should do it.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be you.”</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculabe power of certain acts.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway, okay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a ﬁght. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Hou are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been months—</P>
<P class="p321 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione, it made me think <NOBR>stuff—stuff</NOBR> I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse. I can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my head on straight again, and then I’d have to put the efﬁng thing back <NOBR>on—I</NOBR> can’t do it, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p733 ft9">He had bakced away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. “You can do it,” said Harry. “you can! You’ve just got the sword, I know it’s</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Tell me when,” he croaked.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockmatch. It would have been easy to pity it,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_325">


<P class="p40 ft2">325</P>
<P class="p734 ft10">except that the cut around Harry’s neck still burned. “One . . . two . . . three . . . open.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft9">The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and <NOBR>slitp—pupiled.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing him- self, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.</P>
<P class="p735 ft9">Then avoice hissed out from the Horcrux. “I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Secont best, always, eternally over- shadowed . . . ”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed; He could feel the locket quivering in his grip an dwas scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted.</P>
<P class="p43 ft12">Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the ﬁgures blossomed out of hte locket, ﬁrst chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his ﬁngers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white- hot.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Ron!” he shouted, but the <NOBR>Riddle-Harry</NOBR> was now speaking with Volde- mort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into his face.</P>
<P class="p736 ft11">“Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your <NOBR>presumption—”</NOBR> “Presumption!” echoed the <NOBR>Riddle-Hermione,</NOBR> who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione. She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horriﬁed yet transﬁxed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. “Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen Oe? What are you, compared</P>
<P class="p321 ft2">with the Boy Who Lived?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and the <NOBR>Riddle-Harry</NOBR> and the <NOBR>Riddle-Hermione</NOBR> were reﬂected in them, their hair swirling like ﬂames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet.</P>
<P class="p737 ft9">“You mother confessed,” sneered <NOBR>Riddle-Harry,</NOBR> while <NOBR>Riddle-Hermione</NOBR> jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange . . . ”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned <NOBR>Riddle-Hermione,</NOBR> and she stretched like a snake and engulfed herself around <NOBR>Riddle-Harry,</NOBR> wrapping him in a close em- brace: Their lips met.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face ﬁlled with anguish. He raised the sword high, his arms shaking.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.</P>
<P class="p357 ft2"><NOBR>“Ron—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The sword ﬂashed, plunged; Harry threw hilsemf out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, <NOBR>drawn-out</NOBR> scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but there was nothing to ﬁght.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">The monstrous version of himself and Hermione were gone; There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_327">


<P class="p40 ft2">327</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">the shattered remains of the locket on the ﬂat rock.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; they were also wet.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Harry stopped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Hor- crux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its ﬁnal act.</P>
<P class="p59 ft12">The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke toeach other. With you gone . . . ”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">He could not ﬁnish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absense had cost them.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that, I thought you knew.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.</P>
<P class="p367 ft9">“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I ws <NOBR>a—a—”</NOBR> He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough world would</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">swoop down upon him and claim him.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the sword.</P>

<P class="p93 ft2">“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still- sopping back of Ron’s jacket.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to do is ﬁnd the tent again.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">But it ws not difﬁcult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron my his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with a quickening exitement that he entered the tent. Ron lagging a little behind him.</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination through the bluebell ﬂames still shimmering in a bowl on the ﬂoor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Hermione!”</P>
<P class="p738 ft9">She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. “What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“It’s okay, everything’s ﬁne. More than ﬁne. I’m great. There’s someone here.”</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“What do you mean? <NOBR>Who—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">She saw Ron, who stoop there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s ruck- sack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">Hermione slipped out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and half raised his arms.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_329">


<P class="p348 ft2">329</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">that she could reach.</P>
<P class="p739 ft10"><NOBR>“Ouch—ow—gerroff!</NOBR> What <NOBR>the—?</NOBR> <NOBR>Hermione—OW!”</NOBR> <NOBR>“You—complete—arse—Ronald—Weasley!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced.</P>
<P class="p740 ft10"><NOBR>“You—crawl—back—here—after—weeks—and—weeks—oh,</NOBR> where’s my wand?” She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he reacted</P>
<P class="p741 ft10">instinctively. “Protego!!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward onto the ﬂoor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again.</P>
<P class="p742 ft2">“Hermione!” said Harry. <NOBR>“Calm—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft11">“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!”</P>
<P class="p664 ft2">“Hermione, will you <NOBR>please—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched. “Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps.</P>
<P class="p743 ft10">“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!” “I know,” Ron said. “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m <NOBR>really—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Oh you’re sorry!”</P>
<P class="p744 ft9">She laughed, a <NOBR>high-pitched,</NOBR> <NOBR>out-of-control</NOBR> sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness.</P>
<P class="p666 ft9">“You come back after <NOBR>weeks—weeks—and</NOBR> you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?”</P>
<P class="p666 ft9">“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was ﬁghting back.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of <NOBR>seconds—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Hermione,” interjected Harry who considered this a low blow, “he just saved <NOBR>my—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he <NOBR>knew—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the ﬁrst time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been <NOBR>like—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“What it’s been like for you?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Her voice was now so shirll only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a new level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speech- less, and Ron seized his opportunity.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t go anywhere!”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione thew herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so rightly it seemd unlikely that she would unravel them for several years.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re <NOBR>everywhere—gangs</NOBR> trying to earn gold by rounding up <NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> and blood traiter,s, there’s a reward from the Min- istry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a <NOBR>Muggle-born</NOBR> in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“What did you say to them?”</P>
<P class="p745 ft9">“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.” “And they believed that?”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was deﬁnitely <NOBR>part-troll,</NOBR> the smell off him. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Ron glanced at Hermione. clearly hopeful she might soften at this small</P>

<DIV id="page_331">


<P class="p40 ft2">331</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still ﬁve of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. then two of them got into a ﬁght and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Diapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself <NOBR>again”—Ron</NOBR> held up his right hand to show two missing ﬁngernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows <NOBR>coldly—“and</NOBR> I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been sipmly terriﬁed. Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> snake turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> himself arrived and missed us by about a second.”</P>
<P class="p607 ft9">“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. “Imaging losing ﬁngernails, Harry! That really puts our suffereings into</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">perspective doesn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p746 ft9">“Hermione,” said Harry quietly. “Ron just saved my life.” She appeared not to have heard him.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“one thing I would like to know, though,” she said, ﬁxing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you ﬁnd us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.”</P>
<P class="p747 ft9">Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. “This.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.</P>
<P class="p309 ft2">“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and ﬁerce.</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">He was looking at Hermione.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“No. I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held up the Deluminator again, “came out of this.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone somewhere be- tween skepticism and curiosity.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“My name. ’Ron.’ And you said . . . sometihng about a wand. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">Hermione turned a ﬁery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered. It had been the ﬁrst time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentions it when talking about repairing Harry’s wand.</P>
<P class="p82 ft12">“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside my window.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluis, like that like you get around a Portkey, you know?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it then I put on my rucksack and wnet out into the garden.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.”</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It sort of ﬂoated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index ﬁnger, “right into my chest, and <NOBR>then—it</NOBR> just went straight through.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_333">


<P class="p40 ft2">333</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart. “I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew where I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p59 ft11">“We were there,” said Harry. “We spend two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!”</P>
<P class="p748 ft12">“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.”</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“No, actually, said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisi- bility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the <NOBR>end—and</NOBR> Harry did. Well, I saw the doe ﬁrst, obviously.”</P>

<P class="p42 ft10">They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe nad the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that sometihng was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of</P>

<P class="p53 ft2">“And . . . it went? Just like that?” she whispered.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Well, <NOBR>it—screamed,”</NOBR> said Harry with half a glance at Ron. “Here.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Deciding that it ws at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” “What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket.</P>
<P class="p221 ft2"><NOBR>“Oh—oh</NOBR> yeah.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I ﬁgured it’s always handy to have a backup.”</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s broken.” “You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet,</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">and he looked apprehensive again.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Ron passed Harry the new wand.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“About the best you could hope four, I think,” murmured Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s mufﬂed voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pa- jamas out of his rucksack.</P>

In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only <NOBR>non-mourner</NOBR> at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“Someone helped us.” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe. Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possi- ble locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the ﬁrst. Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spir- its; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, they appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryfﬁndor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difﬁcult to maintain a straight face.</P>

Harry had ﬁnally man- aged to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now ﬁlling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizard- ing world during his weeks away.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">. . . and how did you ﬁnd out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after ex- plaining the many desperate attempts of </SPAN><NOBR>Muggle-borns</NOBR> to evade the Ministry.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“The what?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You and Hermione have stopped saying <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> name!”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling him <NOBR>V—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a boot at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. “Sorry.” said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of hte brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed. Harry, that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical <NOBR>disturbance—it’s</NOBR> how they found us in Totenham Court Road!”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Because we used his name?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Exactly! You’ve got to give htem credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is <NOBR>trackable—quick-</NOBR> <NOBR>and-easy</NOBR> way to ﬁnd they Order members! They nearly got <NOBR>Kingsley—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“You’re kidding?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughfully with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?”</P>
<P class="p752 ft9">“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?” “Oh yeah . . . ”</P>
<P class="p753 ft10">They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. “Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?” “Dumbledore what?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_337">


<P class="p348 ft2">337</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “Dumbledore . . . the doe? I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, “he had the real sword last, didn’t he?”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing be- hind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly com- forting. He shook his head.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s deﬁ- nitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron. “Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’ stories?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate for the answer.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">‘I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh <NOBR>or—or</NOBR> he just wanted to make it more difﬁcult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? <NOBR>He—well,”</NOBR> Ron’s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, “he must’ve known I’d run out on you.”</P>
<P class="p81 ft2">“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve know you’d always want to come back.”</P>
<P class="p254 ft11">Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, “Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?”</P>
<P class="p584 ft9">“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once. “people are talking about it quite a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news. Dumbledore being pals with Grindel-</P>

<P class="p36 ft9">“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against persuing the subject.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Engorgio.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The spider game a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2">“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?”</P>
<P class="p754 ft9">Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders. <NOBR>“Sorry—Reducio.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Ev- ery minor spell he had cast with it so far tha day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intru- sively unfamiliar, like having sombody else’s hand sown to the end of his arm.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them noise- lessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of conﬁdence, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He knew why she wanted to be right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took</P>

<P class="p56 ft10">ﬁrst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.</P>
<P class="p120 ft14">“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the lsat one. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p182 ft14">He drummed lightly on top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fear- ing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered. Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.</P>
<P class="p182 ft2">Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once.</P>
<P class="p755 ft10">“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously. Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. “We need to talk,” she said.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“What?” he said apprehensively. It ﬂew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s verison of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione’s answer, however, was complet- edly unexpected.</P>
<P class="p756 ft9">“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.” He stared at her.</P>

<P class="p757 ft9">“Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him!” <NOBR>“Er—why?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p35 ft9">She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwilling eyes as he saw a photograph of the original letter than Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had writen those words, that they had not been Rita’s invention.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wang, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9"><NOBR>“Er—what</NOBR> are <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR> said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was deﬁnitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it <NOBR>means—I</NOBR> don’t even know if Grindelwald’s stil <NOBR>alive—but</NOBR> we can ask Mr. Lovegood. he was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore’s left he The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to ﬁnd out about the sign?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exaperated. “We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and <NOBR>clues—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up Ron. “I think</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_341">


<P class="p40 ft2">341</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.</P>
<P class="p631 ft10">“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to ﬁnd out for yourself,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Yea,” said Ron syncophantically, “that makes sense.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talke to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going to see <NOBR>Lovegood—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">His hand ﬂew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve seen Love- good, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? where do the Love- goods live, anyway? Do either of you know?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron.. “I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention the,. Shouldn’t be hard to ﬁnd.”</P>
<P class="p758 ft9">When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. “You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”</P>

From their high van- tage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and tree of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christ- mas,” said Hermione coldly.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with and incredulous laugh. “Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? Yeah, and Fred and George woud’ve been great about it. And ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“VBut where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been decent to me. <NOBR>He—he</NOBR> wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d done, but he didn’t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family knew I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alonge. You know, ﬁrst holiday after they were married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Ron turned his back on the Burrow.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence, hidden be- neath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhab- ited apart from one small cotttage, which seemed deserted.</P>
<P class="p759 ft10">“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering thorugh the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the win- dowsill. Ron snorted.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked</P>

<P class="p43 ft14">“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whippped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most <NOBR>strange-looking</NOBR> house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!”</P>
<P class="p761 ft9">“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower. “I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill ﬁrst. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they foun dhim grinning broadly.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">Three <NOBR>hand-painted</NOBR> signs had been tacked to a <NOBR>broken-down</NOBR> gate. The ﬁrst read,</P>

The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry though he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, beat with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavery with <NOBR>berry-sized</NOBR> red fruits and bushy crowns of <NOBR>white-beaded</NOBR> mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly ﬂattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.</P>

<P class="p63 ft10">He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She the rapped three times on th ethick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was ﬂung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyﬂoss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur’s wedding by comparision.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried in a high- pitched, querulous voice, looking ﬁrst at Hermione, then at Ron, and ﬁnally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical O.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not point- ing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s sometihng we’d like to ask you.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a shock . . . My word . . . I</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">. . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“I—oh,</NOBR> all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">they were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind then. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to ﬁt the <NOBR>walls—the</NOBR> stove, the sink, and the <NOBR>cupboards—and</NOBR> all of it had been painted with ﬂowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry though he recognized Luna’s style: The effect in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.</P>

<P class="p119 ft10">In the middle of the ﬂoor, a <NOBR>wrought-iron</NOBR> spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfort- able, and he led the way.</P>
<P class="p190 ft14">The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labryinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize, all ﬂapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Luna was not there; The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry de- cided it was an old fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubbly tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the ﬂoor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muf- ﬂing the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Why have you come here?”</P>
<P class="p766 ft9">Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione lot out a small cry of shock. “Mr. <NOBR>Lovegood—what’s</NOBR> that?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.</P>
<P class="p767 ft9">“It is the horm of a <NOBR>Crumple-Horned</NOBR> Snorkack,” said Xenophilius. “No it isn’t!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the <NOBR>moment—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“The <NOBR>Crumple-Horned</NOBR> Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly, a mullish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature, and its <NOBR>horn—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft11">“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibily <NOBR>dangerous—I</NOBR> don’t know where you got <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p82 ft10">“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a de- lightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?”</P>
<P class="p768 ft9">“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again. “Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seems simultaneously terri- ﬁed and mesmerized.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Yes. The this is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather dangerous . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their ﬁrst duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still bang- ing and clattering beneath the tablecloth.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9"><NOBR>“Er—yes,</NOBR> I have expressed that view. <NOBR>However—”</NOBR> “That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful interal struggle.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione, “Let’s see what she thinks.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_347">


<P class="p348 ft2">347</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difﬁcult to hear over the noise of the printing press, “Luna is down at the stream, ﬁshing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and <NOBR>then—very</NOBR> well. I shall try to help you.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ton times his guts.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters ﬁnd out I was here,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling every- one else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft11">Harry crossed to the window of the far sid of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering rybbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird ﬂuttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other than they had been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger. Xenophilius’s attitude proved that.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beauti- ful but <NOBR>austere-looking</NOBR> witch wearing a most <NOBR>bizarre-looking</NOBR> headdress. Two object that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out form the sides. A tiny pair of gliterring blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Looking at this,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.”</P>
<P class="p769 ft9">They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Welling-</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into Hermione’s arms and joining Harry at the statue’s side. “Modeled, ﬁttingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. ’Wit beyond mea- sure is a man’s greatest treasure!’”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">He indicated the objects like ear trumpets.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“These are the Wrackspurt <NOBR>siphons—to</NOBR> remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area.

Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish. “the Dirgible Plum, so as th enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius. “We make it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink, which was a deep purple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly. “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around you neck at Bill and Fleur’s wed- ding. Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”</P>

<P class="p771 ft2">“The Deathly Hallows?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m not sur- prised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that <NOBR>knuckle-headed</NOBR> young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who attacked me for sport- ing the symbol of a <NOBR>well-known</NOBR> Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the <NOBR>Hallows—at</NOBR> least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft2">He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized <NOBR>bogey-ﬂavored</NOBR> Every Flavor beans.</P>

<P class="p772 ft10">ing his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. “But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup.</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">“I assume that you are all familiar with the “Tale of the Three Brothers’?” Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">gravely.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.”</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. “The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, “Well then, why don’t you read it out loud? Much the best way to make</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">sure we all understand.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Er. . . all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed one top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at <NOBR>twilight—”’</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. “Go on, Hermione.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded ﬁgure.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“‘And Death spoke to <NOBR>them—”’</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_351">


<P class="p40 ft2">351</P>
<P class="p773 ft9">“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?” “It’s a fairy tale, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">“Right, sorry. Go on.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the older brother.</P>
<P class="p120 ft12">“‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">“‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.”’</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, ﬂapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry Hermione.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“‘Then Death stood aside and allowed thee three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they ahd had, and admiring Death’s gifts.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“‘The ﬁrst brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with</P>

<P class="p331 ft10">the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the ﬂoor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the older brother as he lay wine- sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“‘And so Death took the ﬁrst brother for his own.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and he turned it thrice i his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the ﬁgure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“‘And so Death took the second brother for his own.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to ﬁnd him. It was only when he attained a great age that the youngest brother ﬁnally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.”’</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.”</P>
<P class="p774 ft9">“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused. “Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_353">


<P class="p68 ft2">353</P>
<P class="p617 ft10">parchment. “The resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he ﬁnished, enclosing both the line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the Deathly Hallows.”</P>
<P class="p157 ft9">“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows‘ in the story,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a chil- dren’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.”</P>
<P class="p619 ft9">There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low int he sky.</P>
<P class="p775 ft9">“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly. “When you say ‘mast of <NOBR>Death’—”</NOBR> said Ron.</P>
<P class="p73 ft9">“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.”</P>
<P class="p435 ft10">“But then . . . do you mean . . . ” said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these <NOBR>objects—these</NOBR> <NOBR>Hallows—actually</NOBR> exist?”</P>
<P class="p776 ft9">Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. “Well, of course.”</P>
<P class="p777 ft9">“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly <NOBR>believe—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p777 ft9">“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius. “You are, I gather, no unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow, <NOBR>Close-minded.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p778 ft9">“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shock with the strain of not laughing.</P>
<P class="p777 ft9">“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again, “We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. <NOBR>But—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p777 ft9">“Ah, but the Third Hallows is true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm,</P>

<P class="p316 ft14">or carrying a Bedazzling Hex or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned ar- gument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What of it?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Well, how can that be real?”</P>
<P class="p779 ft9">“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“But <NOBR>that’s—I’m</NOBR> sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold <NOBR>of—of</NOBR> all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, “you think that exists too?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius. “The</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_355">


<P class="p40 ft2">355</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">Elder Wand is the Hallo that s most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Which is what?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly a master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wad came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.”</P>
<P class="p358 ft9">Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.”</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">There was a pause. Finally, Hermione asked stifﬂy, “Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . .</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“But have you been misleading me, young woman!” said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. “I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have <NOBR>everything—everything!—to</NOBR> do with the Hallows!”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“@Who are the Peverellls?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,“ said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignorus Peverell.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his foreﬁnger raised pedantically. “The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive proof!”</P>

<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">356</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</SPAN></P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“Of what?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs again. “Ev- erybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be the what the sign really means. This must be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.”</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“I s’pose this is the man who brought us <NOBR>Crumple-Horned</NOBR> Snorkacks,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick up ﬁghts, don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“What are you talking about?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? <NOBR>‘May-born</NOBR> witches will marry Muggles.’ ’Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him. “We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with</P>

<P class="p41 ft10">Xenophilius was that it seemed to make her forget that she was annoyed with Ron. “I think you’re right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d <NOBR>choose—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft9">The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!”</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!” said Hermione. “Whereas the wand would be bound to attract <NOBR>trouble—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an un- beatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re good enough.’ As you as you kept your trap <NOBR>shut—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, looking skeptical. “You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about <NOBR>extra-powerful</NOBR> wands for hundreds of years.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“There have?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, <NOBR>but—oh,</NOBR> it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those <NOBR>wands—the</NOBR> Deathstick and the Wand of <NOBR>Destiny—aren’t</NOBR> the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?” said Ron.</P>

<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">358</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</SPAN></P>
<P class="p167 ft10">Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him.</P>
<P class="p780 ft9">“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius. . . <NOBR>Mad-Eye. . .</NOBR> Dumbledore. . . my parents. . . .”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back, would they?” said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. “I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kit themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorceror’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.</P>
<P class="p31 ft12">“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you realize he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p781 ft2">“Of course <NOBR>not—we’re</NOBR> invisible when we’re under it, Ron!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“But all the stuff he said about the other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in them. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just. . . perfect!”</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone. . . ”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">As they argued in whispered, Harry moved around the room, only half lis-</P>

<P class="p41 ft10">tening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">But Harry had already reached the next level.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with ﬁve beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the por- traits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be ﬁne golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . . friends. . .</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better- groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.</P>
<P class="p782 ft9">“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?” “Excuse me?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Where’s Luna?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Xenophilius halted on the top step.</P>

<P class="p308 ft2"><NOBR>“I—I’ve</NOBR> already told you. She is down at Bortons Bridge, ﬁshing for Plimp- ies.”</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“So why have you only laid that tray for four?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius’s hands shook.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. “Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius frowned, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the ﬂoor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Harry, look at this.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He strode to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words U<SPAN class="ft24">NDESIR</SPAN>- <SPAN class="ft24">ABLE </SPAN>N<SPAN class="ft24">UMBER </SPAN>O<SPAN class="ft24">NE </SPAN>and captioned with the reward money.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. “Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Xenophilius licked his lips.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if <NOBR>I—if</NOBR> <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“Hand over Harry?” Hermione ﬁnished for him.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“No deal,” said Ron ﬂatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his laps drawn back into a dread- ful leer.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_361">


<P class="p40 ft2">361</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib.</P>
<P class="p783 ft9">“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.” “HARRY!” Hermione screamed.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Figures on broomsticks were ﬂying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mis- take just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.</P>
<P class="p42 ft11">There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble ﬂew to all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry ﬂew through the door, then crashed to the ﬂoor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms above his head. He heard Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of sick- ening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Half burried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half o the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were ﬂoating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the stair- case to the kitchen. Then another whit shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her ﬁnger to her lips.</P>
<P class="p121 ft2">the door downstairs crashed open.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers? said a rough voice. “Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?”</P>
<P class="p784 ft9">There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. “No. . . no . . . upstairs. . . Potter!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back for anything less</P>

<P class="p785 ft10">than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before”— another bang, another <NOBR>squeal—“when</NOBR> you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are <NOBR>Crumple”—bang—“Headed”—bang—“Snorkacks?”</NOBR> <NOBR>“No—no—I</NOBR> beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Potter! Really!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there are a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“This place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. “The stairs are completely blocked. Could trying clearing it? Might bring the place down.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“You lying piece of ﬁlth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn. “you’ve never seen Potter in your life, have you? thought you’d lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I swear. . . I swear. . . Potter’s upstairs!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow.</P>
<P class="p786 ft9">“It’s Potter, I tell you ,it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. “Please. . . please. . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. but if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get though the debris on the stairs.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.”</P>
<P class="p787 ft10">He stated to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius’s banging and scrap-</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_363">


<P class="p40 ft2">363</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">ing drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust me, Harry?”</P>
<P class="p447 ft2">Harry nodded.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Me? But <NOBR>Harry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.” Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing</P>
<P class="p628 ft9">press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for.</P>
<P class="p788 ft9">“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight. . . any second. . . ” Xenophilius’s <NOBR>paper-white</NOBR> face appeared over the top of the sideboard.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand ﬁrst into his face, and then at the ﬂoor beneath them. “Deprimo!”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">She had blasted a hole in the sitting room ﬂoor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.</P>

<P class="p161 ft2">“Oh I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione, “That’s why I wanted</P>
<P class="p790 ft9">the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“Why hide me though?” asked Ron.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione, “They should be all right. They don’t know anything.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know what we’d do without you.”</P>
<P class="p792 ft9">She beamed, but became solemn at once. “What about Luna?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still <NOBR>Alive—“</NOBR> began Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be alive, she must!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she survives the place, though. . . Loads don’t. . . ”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. “She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius <NOBR>if—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p222 ft9"><NOBR>“—if</NOBR> he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,” said Ron. They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. Af-</P>
<P class="p203 ft9">ter their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows. . . such rubbish. . . although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">367</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s Invisibility <NOBR>Cloak—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione ﬁrmly. “A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his ﬁngers.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“There’s no such thing, Harry!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You said there have been loads of <NOBR>wands—the</NOBR> Deathstick and whatever they were <NOBR>called—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft12">“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her ﬁngers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!”</P>
<P class="p102 ft9">“When my wand connected with <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s,</NOBR> it made my mum and dad appear. . . and Cedric. . . ”</P>
<P class="p190 ft11">“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said Hermione. “Those kind <NOBR>of—of</NOBR> pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.”</P>
<P class="p361 ft12">“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . ”</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">sion. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to ﬁnd the name ’Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I bor- rowed it from Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the <NOBR>pure-blood</NOBR> families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.”</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“Extinct in the male line?” repeated Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“It means the name died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just be called something different.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name “Peverell”: a ﬁlthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry ofﬁcial, and he cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Sorry said Ron and Hermione together.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Marvolo Gaunt! <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ron and Hermione looked bewildered.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see what it looked like?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes.</P>

<DIV id="page_369">


<P class="p348 ft2">369</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“Blimey. . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? “Why not said Harry excitedly, “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who</P>
<P class="p674 ft10">lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.”</P>
<P class="p793 ft9">“Yes. . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re <NOBR>think—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft11">“Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. “It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it was the Resurrection Stone?”</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">Ron’s mouth fell open.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“Blimey—but</NOBR> would it still work if Dumbledore <NOBR>broke—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you’re trying to ﬁt everything into the Hallows <NOBR>story—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it ﬁts of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!” “Where’d you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did Dumb-</P>

<P class="p93 ft2">“But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s. . .</P>

<P class="p89 ft2">“Harry?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his ﬁngers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. . .</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">And then, with a gasp, he remembered—</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!”</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. “My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why!</P>
<P class="p674 ft10">He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . ” Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my ancestor. I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his ﬁngers shaking hard.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Something fell to the ﬂoor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_371">


<P class="p348 ft2">371</P>
<P class="p519 ft9">and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.</P>
<P class="p794 ft9">“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the <NOBR>ring—it’s</NOBR> in the Snitch!” <NOBR>“You—you</NOBR> reckon?”</P>
<P class="p736 ft10">He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything ﬁt, everything. . . His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was ﬁnd the ﬁrst Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then— But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the</P>
<P class="p795 ft9">darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. “That’s what he’s after.”</P>
<P class="p796 ft9">The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. <NOBR>“You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> after the Elder Wand.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking. . .</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them?</P>
<P class="p797 ft10">Harry gazed into the darkness. . . . If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the ﬁrst place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Hor- crux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret?</P>
<P class="p798 ft9">Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three. . . . for the wand</P>

<P class="p799 ft9">The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history. . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of <NOBR>smoke-gray</NOBR> and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discov- eries.</P>
<P class="p82 ft10">He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“This is it?” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, “This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve got <NOBR>one—maybe</NOBR> <NOBR>two—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p168 ft2">He held up the Snitch.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize. . . he just thinks it’s a powerful <NOBR>wand—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But don’t you see? It all <NOBR>ﬁts—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Not, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please,” she said as she started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of <NOBR>Death—Harry,</NOBR> why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?”</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">He had his answer ready.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to ﬁnd out about them for yourself! It’s a Quest!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!” cried Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really believe it!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Harry took no notice.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Dumbledore usually let me ﬁnd out stuff for myself. He let me try my</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">373</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and Dum- bledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get <NOBR>sidetracked—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">She appealed to Ron.</P>
<P class="p800 ft9">“You don’t believe in this, do you?” Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“I dunno. . . I mean. . . bits of it sort of ﬁt together,” said Ron awkwardly, “But when you look at the whole thing. . . ” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe. . . maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take ﬁrst watch.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a ﬁerce full stop.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">I open at the close. . . . But what was the close? Why couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person. . . and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open. . . .</P>
<P class="p801 ft10">And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Volde- mort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Volde- mort’s thoughts, because for the ﬁrst time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . .</P>

<P class="p38 ft10">It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azka- ban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers would be virtu- ally unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning. . .</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">If only there was a way of getting a better wand. . .</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swal- lowed him once more. . . .</P>
<P class="p166 ft12">They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a ﬂame had been lit inside him that noth- ing, not Hermione’s ﬂat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the ﬁercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joy- ful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low ﬁerce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the one with an obses- sion, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained</P>

<P class="p168 ft2">“‘The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,”’ Harry quoted calmly.</P>
<P class="p802 ft9">“I thought it was <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> we were supposed to be ﬁghting?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.</P>
<P class="p166 ft11">Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on dis- cussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague im- ages with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new <NOBR>self-absorption,</NOBR> that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage. . . ”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to</P>

<P class="p803 ft10">“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is a Wizard- ing village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.” These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occa-</P>
<P class="p326 ft2">sional sight of Snatchers.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said on <NOBR>Potterwatch—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“On what?” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all of the programs are following <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . ”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of “A Caul- dron Full of Hot, Strong Love.” While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them. “Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end. . . ”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ’Albus’! Get in here, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Roused for the ﬁrst time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to ﬁnd Ron and Hermione kneeling on the ﬂoor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword</P>

<P class="p804 ft9">“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione. “I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“. . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was saying, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Hi.”</P>

<P class="p45 ft9">“‘River”’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names, but you can usually <NOBR>tell—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Shh!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p594 ft10">“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.” Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at</P>
<P class="p181 ft2">one another in horror.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle- born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped.

<P class="p30 ft10">Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the ﬁrst time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we can return to regular contrib- utor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.”</P>
<P class="p805 ft9">“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. “Kingsley!” burst out Ron.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ’Wizards ﬁrst’? asked Lee.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I’d say that it’s one short step from ’Wizards ﬁrst’ to ’Purebloods ﬁrst,’ and then to ’Death Eaters,”’ replied Kingsley. “We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ’Pals of Potter.”’</P>

<P class="p806 ft10">Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. “We know it’s Lupin!”</P>
<P class="p172 ft9">“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">“I do,” said Lupin ﬁrmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ’The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are ﬁghting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?” “I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, “And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.”</P>
<P class="p807 ft9">Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. “Nearly always right,” she repeated.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“. . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffer- ing for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken support- ers of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Loveg- ood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus <NOBR>Hagrid”—all</NOBR> three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the <NOBR>sentence—“well-</NOBR> known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ’Support Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.”</P>

<P class="p808 ft9">“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen- <NOBR>foot-high</NOBR> half brother?” asked Lee.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ’Sup- port Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potter- watch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?”</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together:</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Fred!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“No—is</NOBR> it George?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said,</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“I’m not being ’Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ’Rapier’!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Oh, all right then, ’Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the vari- ous stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, <NOBR>You-Know-</NOBR> Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen <NOBR>You-Know-Whos</NOBR> running around the place.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">381</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is <NOBR>You-Know-Who,</NOBR> that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">For the ﬁrst time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked Lee.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning to take any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety ﬁrst!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee. ”Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be <NOBR>’Mad-Eye.’</NOBR> Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.</P>
<P class="p809 ft9">“Good, eh?” said Ron happily. “Brilliant,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they were found</P>
<P class="p198 ft2">. . . ”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now the broad- cast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. “He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!”</P>

<P class="p811 ft10">“The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore— we’ve got to put the protection back around <NOBR>us—quickly—it’s</NOBR> how they <NOBR>ﬁnd—“</NOBR> But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket</P>
<P class="p515 ft2">and clicked it: Their lamps went out.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!”</P>

<P class="p338 ft9">and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Get up, vermin.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the black- thorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrec- ognizable beneath his ﬁngers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suf- fered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or ﬁve people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10"><NOBR>“Get—off—her!”</NOBR> Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuck- les hitting ﬂesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious girl. . . what a treat</P>

<P class="p38 ft10">Harry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Search the tent!” said another voice.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?”</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">Harry did not answer immediately.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain. “what happened to you?”</P>
<P class="p813 ft10">“Stung.” Harry muttered. “Been Stung.” “Yeah, looks like it.” said a second voice. “What’s your name?” snarled Greyback. “Dudley.” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p814 ft9">“And your ﬁrst name?” <NOBR>“I—Vernon.</NOBR> Vernon Dudley.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Check the list, Scabior.” said Greyback, and Harry head him move side- ways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you, ginger?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Stan Shunpike.” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Like ’ell you are.” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">There was another thud.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. “Bardy Weasley.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood traitors even if</P>

<P class="p191 ft2">“Easy, Greyback.” said Scabior over the jeering of the others.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">”Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remem- bering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?</P>
<P class="p190 ft2">“Penelope Clearwater.” said Hermione. She sounded terriﬁed, but convinc- ing.</P>
<P class="p815 ft9">“What’s your blood status?” <NOBR>“Half-Blood.”</NOBR> said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts <NOBR>age—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“We’b lebt,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lords name?”</P>
<P class="p555 ft9">“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.” “Accident?” There was more jeering laughter.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley?” growled Greyback, “The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Doh.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him <NOBR>back-to-back</NOBR> with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his <NOBR>puffed-up</NOBR> eyes. When at last the man tying then had walked away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“Anyone still got a wand?”</P>
<P class="p816 ft10">“No.” Said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. “This is all my fault. I said the name. I’m <NOBR>sorry—”</NOBR> “Harry?”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">It was a new, but familiar voice. and it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione’s left.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Dean?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It is you! If they ﬁnd out who they’ve <NOBR>got—!</NOBR> They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for <NOBR>gold—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Not a bad little haul for one night.” Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he roared.</P>
<P class="p817 ft9">“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley un ’ere, Greyback.” “Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the inﬁnitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a differ- ent name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that.” leered Scabior out of the shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It’s in the dungeons.” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake, so the light’s all green,”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">There was a short pause.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little Slytherin.” said Scabior. “Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who’s your father?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. “Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_387">


<P class="p348 ft2">387</P>
<P class="p308 ft2">“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think there is a Dudley in there.”</P>
<P class="p271 ft2">Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?</P>
<P class="p317 ft10">“Well, well.” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepida- tion in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry Ofﬁcial. Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this. Greyback!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">A dark ﬁgure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their wands. They had found Gryfﬁndor’s sword.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10"><NOBR>“Ve–e–ery</NOBR> nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks <NOBR>goblin-made,</NOBR> that. Where did you get something like this?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut <NOBR>ﬁrewood—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his dis- tended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out any- thing around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, <NOBR>jet-black</NOBR> and forbidding: Voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become <NOBR>Razor-Sharp</NOBR> again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric pur- pose . . . .</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">So close . . . So close . . .</P>
<P class="p818 ft9">With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook</P>

<P class="p63 ft10">Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, nor to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of Grey- back’s boots as he crouched down, in front of Hermione.</P>
<P class="p820 ft9">“you know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” “It isn’t! It isn’t me!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Hermione’s terriﬁed squeak was as good as a confession.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“. . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,” repeated Greyback quietly.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was Exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort’s thoughts. It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Well, this changed things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a ﬁlthy ﬁnger to the taught scar.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">”Don’t touch it! Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be sick from the pain of it.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. “There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, <NOBR>wait—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still ﬁghting to remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind—</P>
<P class="p83 ft2"><NOBR>—He</NOBR> was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress—</P>

<P class="p239 ft2">No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger—</P>
<P class="p197 ft2"><NOBR>—looking</NOBR> up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower—</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices—</P>

<P class="p45 ft9">“To hell with the Ministry.” growled Greyback. “They’ll take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to <NOBR>You-Know-Who.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t <NOBR>got—they</NOBR> say he’s using the Malfoy’s place as a base. We’ll take the boy there.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The were- wolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Harry’s scar seared again—</P>
<P class="p45 ft9"><NOBR>—and</NOBR> he rose into the night, ﬂying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower—</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“. . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re dead.” “Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment of inade-</P>
<P class="p377 ft10">quacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10"><NOBR>—The</NOBR> window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter. . . . A skeletal ﬁgure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ?</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune right there.”</P>

<P class="p38 ft12">They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, try- ing to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still—</P>
<P class="p308 ft9"><NOBR>—as</NOBR> he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor inside the <NOBR>cell-like</NOBR> room—</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of <NOBR>wrought-iron</NOBR> gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experi- enced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was ﬁghting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter. . . .</P>
<P class="p821 ft9">One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. “How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I <NOBR>can’t—blimey!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. “State your purpose!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve captured Harry Potter!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">The gates swung open.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that mufﬂed their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">391</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">he was staggering along sideways, tied <NOBR>back-to-back</NOBR> to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . .</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">The emaciated ﬁgure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes ﬁxed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . .</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was pointless. I never had it.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You lie!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, ﬁghting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Light spilled out over all of them.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice.</P>
<P class="p822 ft9">“We’re here to see <NOBR>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!”</NOBR> rasped Greyback. “Who are you?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice. “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shufﬂe around too.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“I know ’es swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior. “If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. And this ’ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am. There’s no doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’Ere, <NOBR>ma’am—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p823 ft9">Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Bring them in,” she said.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crys- tal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two ﬁgures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble ﬁreplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“What is this?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry’s ears. He was panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts, though his scar was still burning.</P>
<P class="p453 ft10">“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco, come here.” Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a ﬁgure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">blur beneath <NOBR>white-blond</NOBR> hair.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry was facing a mirror over the ﬁreplace, a great gilded thing in an in- tricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reﬂection for the ﬁrst time since leaving Grimmauld Place.</P>
<P class="p38 ft14">His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione’s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2">“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is it Harry Potter?”</P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“I <NOBR>can’t—I</NOBR> can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_393">


<P class="p40 ft2">393</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">him.</P>
<P class="p47 ft9">“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, every- thing will be <NOBR>forgiv—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did he get into this state?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“That wasn’t us.”</P>
<P class="p824 ft9">“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius. His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“There’s something there,” he whispered. “it could be the scar, stretched tight. . . .” Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the ﬁreplace where his mother stood watching.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is <NOBR>his”—she</NOBR> was looking closely at the blackthorn wand— “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again,</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">so that the light fell on Hermione instead.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. <NOBR>“Yes—yes,</NOBR> she was in Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s <NOBR>friends—Draco,</NOBR> look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his <NOBR>name—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could be.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes,</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Grander?” “Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius, “And beside her, we think, Potter!</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">Potter and his friends, caught at last!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the ﬂesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master—</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my <NOBR>authority—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p236 ft10">“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the <NOBR>boy—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the <NOBR>gold—“</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_395">


<P class="p40 ft2">395</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her <NOBR>brother-in-law,</NOBR> her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “Take your gold, ﬁlthy scav- enger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honor of <NOBR>his—of—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">She stopped struggling, her dark eyes ﬁxed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve—</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix, “Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Lucius froze, his index ﬁnger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of vision.</P>
<P class="p825 ft10">“What is that?” he heard her say. “Sword,” grunted an <NOBR>out-of-sight</NOBR> Snatcher. “Give it to me.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“It’s not yours, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">There was a bang and a ﬂash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand.</P>
<P class="p826 ft9">“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?” “Stupefy!” she screamed, ”Stupefy!”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no con- science. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryfﬁndor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. “Release me, woman!” “Where did you ﬁnd this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face,</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">“Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!”</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his ﬁlthy curved nails clutching its back.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to ﬁnish them, then leave them in the court- yard for me.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Don’t you dare speak to Draco <NOBR>like—“</NOBR> said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered, more to herself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he ﬁnds out . . . I must . . . I must know. . . .”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">She turned back to her sister again.</P>
<P class="p827 ft9">“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!” “This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in <NOBR>my—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we’re in!” shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of ﬁre issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet.</P>
<P class="p828 ft9">Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. “Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.”</P>
<P class="p829 ft9">“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except. . . . except for the Mudblood.” Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Bellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the room.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said. “Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to <NOBR>them—yet.”</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_397">


<P class="p348 ft2">397</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shufﬂe across to another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s ﬁnished with her?” Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep ﬂight of stairs, still tied <NOBR>back-to-back</NOBR> and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above them.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. “HERMIONE!”</P>
<P class="p830 ft9">“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a <NOBR>way—“</NOBR> “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”</P>
<P class="p831 ft9">“We need a plan, stop <NOBR>yelling—we</NOBR> need to get these ropes <NOBR>off—“</NOBR> “Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? Is that you?”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer.</P>
<P class="p832 ft9">“Harry? Ron?” “Luna?”</P>
<P class="p833 ft9">“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!” “Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . . ”</P>
<P class="p834 ft11">Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft11">“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I think it was beside the water jug.”</P>
<P class="p835 ft9">She was back within seconds. “You’ll need to stay still,” she said.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough ﬁbers to work the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?”</P>
<P class="p836 ft9">“We found <NOBR>it—we</NOBR> found <NOBR>it—PLEASE!”</NOBR> Hermione screamed again; Ron strug- gled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist.</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see what I’m <NOBR>doing—“</NOBR> “My pocket!” said Ron, “In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator, and it’s full of</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">light!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent ﬂew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, ﬂooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless ﬁgure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the ﬂoor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">From above came Bellatrix’s voice.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“You’re lying, ﬁlthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!”</P>
<P class="p837 ft9">Another terrible scream— “HERMIONE!”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“There!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_399">


<P class="p348 ft2">399</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trap- door. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said “Thanks” to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar ﬂoor, looking groggy and disori- ented, many welts across his swarthy face.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. “The cellar is completely <NOBR>escape-proof.</NOBR> I tried, at ﬁrst. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like phys- ical pain. Barely conscious of the ﬁerce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!”</P>
<P class="p838 ft14">Hermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his ﬁsts, and Harry in utter desperation seized Ha- grid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumble- dore’s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know <NOBR>what—nothing</NOBR> happened— he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were <NOBR>lifeless—the</NOBR> mirror fragment fell sparkling to the ﬂoor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue—</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">The eye blinked and was gone.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reﬂected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream. “Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But we can ﬁnd out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the ﬂoor. “Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them</P>
<P class="p671 ft9">that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, <NOBR>please—“</NOBR> He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco’s</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">shaking voice spoke from behind the door.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you!”</P>
<P class="p272 ft10">They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Delumina- tor and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness. The door ﬂew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar.</P>
<P class="p81 ft11">Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light ﬂew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the <NOBR>house-elf,</NOBR> who had just Apparated into their midst.</P>
<P class="p64 ft2"><NOBR>“DOB—!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terriﬁed at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Dobby’s enormous, <NOBR>tennis—ball</NOBR> shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“But how did <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_401">


<P class="p40 ft2">401</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the essentials.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears ﬂapping.</P>
<P class="p839 ft9">“And you can take humans with you?” Dobby nodded again.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take <NOBR>them—take</NOBR> them <NOBR>to—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p425 ft9">“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!” The elf nodded for a third time.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ol- livander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.</P>
<P class="p840 ft9">“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered. “We can’t leave you here,” said Dean.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not understand. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Go!” Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just go!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">They caught hold of the elf’s outstretched ﬁngers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. “Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Harry and Ron stared at each other.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2"><NOBR>“Draco—no,</NOBR> call Wormtail! Make him go and check!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft17">Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar.</P>
<P class="p94 ft10">“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron. They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door. I’m coming in.” The door ﬂew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns ﬂoating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, mufﬂing his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail’s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry’s throat.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s wheezy voice. “All ﬁne!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Harry could barely breathe.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal ﬁngers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The silver ﬁngers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched him- self free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand from his other hand.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_403">


<P class="p40 ft2">403</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver ﬁngers were moving inex- orably toward his own throat.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“No—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft12">Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly ser- vant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“No!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal ﬁngers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the ﬂoor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryfﬁndor’s sword in his long- ﬁngered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely stirring.</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?”</P>
<P class="p841 ft9">Harry waited, holding his breath, ﬁghting against the prickling of his scar. “No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.”</P>
<P class="p842 ft9">“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?” “Yes,” said the goblin.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Good,” she said, and with a casual ﬂick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph, “we</P>

<P class="p86 ft2">And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her foreﬁnger to the Dark Mark.</P>
<P class="p317 ft10">At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true sur- roundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he <NOBR>felt—he</NOBR> had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Pot- ter. If they were mistaken . . .</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be <NOBR>yours—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p123 ft10">And Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light ﬁlled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . .</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mudblood. Grey- back, take her if you want her.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead—</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix, and hers ﬂew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, “Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light ﬂew from Draco’s, Nar- cissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; Harry threw himself to the ﬂoor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“STOP OR SHE DIES!</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione’s throat.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see exactly how ﬁlthy her blood is!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_405">


<P class="p68 ft2">405</P>
<P class="p155 ft9">Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix’s.</P>
<P class="p73 ft9">“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.</P>
<P class="p73 ft11">“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the ﬂoor at his feet, Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height.</P>
<P class="p843 ft9">“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!”</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort ﬂying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out.</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. “Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.”</P>
<P class="p157 ft14">At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The chande- lier crashed to the ﬂoor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryfﬁndor. Glittering shards of crystal ﬂew in all directions; Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face.</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, ﬂew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.</P>
<P class="p157 ft9">As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair ﬂying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">“Dobby!” she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. “You! You dropped the <NOBR>chandelier—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft2">The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking ﬁnger pointing at his old mistress.</P>
<P class="p351 ft2">“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa’s wand too ﬂew into the air and landed on the other side of the room.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Ron, <NOBR>catch—and</NOBR> GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen ﬁgures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blue of ﬂying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife ﬂew across the room at the place where he was vanishing—</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would sufﬁce to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryfﬁndor’s sword bumping against his back: Dobby’s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the ﬁngers, to indicate that that was ﬁne with them. . . .</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_407">


<P class="p40 ft2">407</P>
<P class="p268 ft2">relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground.</P>
<P class="p363 ft9">“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whim- pered.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to ﬁght if he needed to. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?”</P>
<P class="p844 ft9">He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. “DOBBY!”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">The elf swayed slightly, stars reﬂected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9"><NOBR>“Dobby—no—HELP!”</NOBR> Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t <NOBR>die—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p269 ft9">The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . . ”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.</P>

<P class="p845 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">I</SPAN>t was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hog- warts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass,</P>
<P class="p846 ft9">pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby. . . Dobby. . . ” even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. “Hermione,” he said suddenly. “Where is she?” “Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.” Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.</P>
<P class="p160 ft11">The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions, Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it,</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean.</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">“I want to do it properly,” were the ﬁrst words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a spade?” And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the <NOBR>non-magic</NOBR> of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out. . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . .</P>
<P class="p850 ft9">The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows. . . Horcruxes. . . Hallows no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Volde- mort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmen- gard, and why. . .</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . How much more had he known?</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. “How’s Hermione?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_411">


<P class="p68 ft2">411</P>
<P class="p302 ft14">“Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.” Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough.</P>
<P class="p434 ft10">Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby’s head, mufﬂing his batlike ears. “We should close his eyes.”</P>
<P class="p434 ft14">Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be <NOBR>Skele-Gro.</NOBR> Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur’s coats, crouched down and placed her ﬁngers tenderly upon each of the elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. “There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”</P>
<P class="p76 ft11">Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go ﬁrst, shall I?”</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.”</P>
<P class="p434 ft9">She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “yeah. . . thanks Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">swallowed. “Good bye Dobby,” he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’ya mind if I stay here a moment?” He asked the others.</P>
<P class="p36 ft11">They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf.</P>
<P class="p82 ft11">He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the ﬂower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:</P>
<P class="p851 ft1">HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.</P>
<P class="p308 ft10">He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was <NOBR>light-colored,</NOBR> pretty, with a small ﬁre of driftwood burning brightly in the ﬁreplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“. . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.” He looked around and saw Harry standing there. “I’ve been getting them all out of the</P>

<P class="p617 ft10">Burrow,” he explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the <NOBR>family—don’t</NOBR> apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood traitor family there is.”</P>
<P class="p434 ft14">“How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret- Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m <NOBR>Secret-Keeper</NOBR> here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend. Fleur’s given him <NOBR>Skele-Gro—we</NOBR> could probably move them in an hour <NOBR>or—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p304 ft10">“No,” Harry said and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.” He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled.</P>
<P class="p157 ft14">“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them, straight away.” He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. . .</P>
<P class="p852 ft10">Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.</P>
<P class="p157 ft12">Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all.</P>
<P class="p853 ft9">And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his ﬁngers, pressed together as if in prayer.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">You gave Ron the Deluminator. . . You understood him. . . . You gave him a way back. . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. . . .</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">And if you knew them. . . What did you know about me, Dumbledore?</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d feel that? Is that why you made it this difﬁcult? So I’d have time to work that out?</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then ﬂashed across his mind, swift as the reﬂection of a dragonﬂy over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said.</P>
<P class="p220 ft9">“No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both too <NOBR>tired—”</NOBR> “I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">now. <NOBR>Privately—and</NOBR> separately. It’s urgent.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up here with a dead <NOBR>house-elf</NOBR> and a <NOBR>half-conscious</NOBR> goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me <NOBR>anything—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry ﬂatly. “You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, “All right. Who do you want to talk to ﬁrst?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows?</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_415">


<P class="p40 ft2">415</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook ﬁrst.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were <NOBR>amazing—coming</NOBR> up with that story when she was hurting you like <NOBR>that—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p854 ft9">Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a <NOBR>one-armed</NOBR> squeeze. “What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You’ll see. Come on.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it.</P>
<P class="p43 ft12">“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room, it too had a view of the sea, now ﬂecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.</P>
<P class="p855 ft9">“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your legs?” “Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">He was still clutching the sword of Gryfﬁndor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin, his long thin ﬁngers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a <NOBR>house-elf,</NOBR> but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human’s.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“You probably don’t <NOBR>remember—”</NOBR> Harry began.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2"><NOBR>“—that</NOBR> I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the ﬁrst time you</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Yes,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p856 ft9">Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. “You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.”</P>
<P class="p857 ft9">“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. “You dug the grave.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“So?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gathered himself for the attack.</P>
<P class="p858 ft10">“Griphook, I need to <NOBR>ask—”</NOBR> “You also rescued a goblin.” “What?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“You brought me here. Saved me.”</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one ﬁnger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_417">


<P class="p40 ft2">417</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">He closed his mind ﬁrmly. He needed to deal with Griphook ﬁrst. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“Harry—”</NOBR> said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I ﬁrst met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.”</P>
<P class="p482 ft10">“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was of- fended at the idea of its defenses being breached. “Its protection was minimal.” “Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guessing its protec-</P>
<P class="p461 ft2">tion will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs to the Lestranges.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“You have no chance,” said Griphook ﬂatly. “No chance at all. If you seek beneath our ﬂoors, a treasure that was never <NOBR>yours—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Thief, you have been warned, <NOBR>beware—yeah,</NOBR> I know, I remember,” said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft11">The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.</P>
<P class="p102 ft10">“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek per- sonal gain,” said Griphook ﬁnally, “it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from <NOBR>wand-carriers.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft10"><NOBR>“Wand-carriers,”</NOBR> repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been contested</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">between wizards and goblins.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron. “You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have <NOBR>never—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color. “This isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical <NOBR>creature—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Griphook gave a nasty laugh.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more pow- erful, your race is set still more ﬁrmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wiz- arding rule, <NOBR>house-elves</NOBR> are slaughtered, and who amongst the <NOBR>wand-carriers</NOBR> protests?”</P>
<P class="p94 ft11">“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. “We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!”</P>
<P class="p664 ft2">“Don’t call <NOBR>yourself—”</NOBR> Ron muttered.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked. “Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron ﬁdgeted uncomfort- ably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t want <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> defeated more than we do, Griphook!”</P>
<P class="p374 ft10">The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry. “What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked abruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_419">


<P class="p348 ft2">419</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">you back there.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked Harry. “Perhaps you’ve seen other things in there?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">The goblin twisted his beard around his ﬁnger again.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our ﬁngers.”</P>
<P class="p859 ft9">The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“So young,” he said ﬁnally, “to be ﬁghting so many.”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of breaking in with- out a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.”</P>
<P class="p860 ft10">“I shall . . . think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly. <NOBR>“But—”</NOBR> Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. “Thank you,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then ﬂexed his short legs.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s bed, “that the <NOBR>Skele-Gro</NOBR> has ﬁnished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryfﬁndor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the <NOBR>still-dark</NOBR> landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terriﬁed when she thought we’d been in</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petriﬁed <NOBR>You-Know-</NOBR> Who would ﬁnd out about.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“But I thought we were looking for places <NOBR>You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> been, places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking bafﬂed. “Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry. “He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the ﬁrst time he ever went to Diagon Alley.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most de- voted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it night he came back, I heard him.”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">Harry rubbed his scar.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a trea- sured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me. . . except for Hogwarts.”</P>
<P class="p861 ft9">When Harry had ﬁnished speaking, Ron shook his head. “You really understand him.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come <NOBR>on—Ollivander</NOBR> now.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_421">


<P class="p40 ft2">421</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the <NOBR>cliff-top</NOBR> garden and the freshly dug grave.</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“My dear boy,” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us, I thought we would die in that place, I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“We were glad to do it.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a ﬂutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook ﬁrst. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.”</P>
<P class="p862 ft9">“Anything. Anything.” Said the wandmaker weakly. “Can you mend this? Is it possible?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves in his palm.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Yes,” said Harry. “Can <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft11">“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft10">Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Olli- vander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Can you identify these?” Harry asked.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The wandmaker took the ﬁrst of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his <NOBR>knobble-knuckled</NOBR> ﬁngers, ﬂexing it slightly.</P>
<P class="p863 ft9">“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. <NOBR>“Twelve-and-three-quarter</NOBR> inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“And this one?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ollivander performed the same examination.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”</P>
<P class="p864 ft9">“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?” “Perhaps not. If you took <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><NOBR>“—I</NOBR> <NOBR>did—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10"><NOBR>“—then</NOBR> it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.”</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. “You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like they can</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">think for themselves.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft2">“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p317 ft10">“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest afﬁnity between wizard and wand. These connec- tions are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experi- ence, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.”</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it safely?”</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_423">


<P class="p348 ft2">423</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">will usually bend its will to its new master.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. <NOBR>Nine-and-a-quarter</NOBR> inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.”</P>
<P class="p781 ft2">“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ollivander swallowed.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. “Legends about a <NOBR>wand—or</NOBR> <NOBR>wands—that</NOBR> have been passed from hand to hand by murder.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“And <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p865 ft9"><NOBR>“I—how?”</NOBR> croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. “How do you know this?”</P>
<P class="p200 ft9">“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ollivander looked terriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, <NOBR>I-I</NOBR> had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin cores? You said he</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Ollivander looked horriﬁed, transﬁxed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . .</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t he?”</P>
<P class="p866 ft9">“How do you know this?” Harry did not answer.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked ﬂabbergasted.</P>
<P class="p214 ft10">“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, “had al- ways been happy with the wand I made <NOBR>him—yes</NOBR> and phoenix feather, thirteen- <NOBR>and-a-half</NOBR> <NOBR>inches—until</NOBR> he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond re- pair,” said Harry quietly.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know that, Harry, how could <NOBR>he—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them <NOBR>re-create</NOBR> the spells they’ve cast lately, they’d see that yours broke mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.”</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">425</P>
<P class="p195 ft11">The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about that <NOBR>now—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p392 ft2">But Mr. Ollivander intervened.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“And will it?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said Ollivander, “but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">. . . formidable.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they ﬁrst met, of how much he like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.</P>
<P class="p59 ft2"><NOBR>“You—you</NOBR> really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p867 ft14">“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand’s course through history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authen- ticity.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“So <NOBR>you—you</NOBR> don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Hermione asked hopefully.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”</P>
<P class="p868 ft9">Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. “But <NOBR>how—how</NOBR> do <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. “You told You- <NOBR>Know-Who</NOBR> that Gregorovitch had the wand?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?”</P>
<P class="p869 ft9"><NOBR>“The—the</NOBR> what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. “The Deathly Hallows.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll leave you to get some rest now.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Ollivander looked stricken.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“I do,” said Harry, “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_427">


<P class="p40 ft2">427</P>
<P class="p268 ft14">he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said, “I saw You- <NOBR>Know-Who</NOBR> trying to ﬁnd him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t <NOBR>know—but</NOBR> if Gre- gorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difﬁ- cult.”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the <NOBR>pre-dawn,</NOBR> coming closer and closer.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.”</P>
<P class="p587 ft9">“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But <NOBR>then—where</NOBR> is it now?” “At Hogwarts,” said Harry, ﬁghting to remain with them in the <NOBR>cliff-top</NOBR> gar-</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">den.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it before he does!”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known <NOBR>this—why</NOBR> have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook ﬁrst? We could have <NOBR>gone—we</NOBR> could still <NOBR>go—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">me to get the Horcruxes.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold voice. “Leave me now.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s ﬁgure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his ﬁrst kingdom, his birthright. . . .</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">And here it was, beside the lake, reﬂected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How ﬁtting that this would be its last great act.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded ﬁgure was as long as thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore’s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks ﬂew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.</P>

<P class="p0 ft7">Chapter 25</P>
<P class="p95 ft4">Shell Cottage</P>
<P class="p415 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">B</SPAN>ill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its</P>
<P class="p442 ft10">garden, he could hear the constant ebb and ﬂow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the <NOBR>cliff-top</NOBR> view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to ﬁnish off <NOBR>You-Know-Who?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p36 ft10">The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she main- tained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken posses- sion of it was repellent, not to be considered.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and again. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore’s inten- tions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Yes, he is. Ron, please don’t start that again!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry, who contin- ued to gaze at the horizon. “The solve doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the <NOBR>mirror—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p870 ft9">“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t you, Harry?” “I could have,” said Harry without looking at her.</P>
<P class="p551 ft9">“But you don’t thing you did, do you?” asked Ron. “No, I don’t,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” “I <NOBR>can’t—but</NOBR> can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he’s lying</P>
<P class="p454 ft9">in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” “Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There was little</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_431">


<P class="p40 ft2">431</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. “He would have gone on.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“What d’you mean, ’gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “’Arry?”</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair ﬂying in the breeze. “’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest bedroom,</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cot- tage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a ﬁery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin, who was sit- ting <NOBR>cross-legged</NOBR> in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly ﬁngers. “Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook, thank you, we’re <NOBR>really—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p871 ft9"><NOBR>“—in</NOBR> return,” said the goblin ﬁrmly, “for payment.” Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated.</P>
<P class="p872 ft9">“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.” “Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.”</P>
<P class="p873 ft10">His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. “I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryfﬁndor.” Harry’s spirits plummeted.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">He had said the wrong thing. Griphook ﬂushed angrily.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The sword’s <NOBR>ours—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“it is not,” said the goblin. “We’re Gryfﬁndors, and it was Godric Gryfﬁndor’s—</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“And before it was Gryfﬁndor’s, whose was it?” demanded the goblin, sitting up straight.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long ﬁnger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryfﬁndor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblin- work! It belongs with the goblins. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!”</P>
<P class="p308 ft11">Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?”</P>
<P class="p664 ft2">The goblin nodded, looking sour.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the ﬁreplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.”</P>
<P class="p453 ft10">“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by Gryfﬁndor?” “I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account that</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">I know of that says Gryfﬁndor stole the sword.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron.” said Hermione. “They’ve been treated brutally in the past.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Goblins aren’t exactly ﬂuffy little bunnies, though, are they?” said Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_433">


<P class="p40 ft2">433</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. There’s a fake in these, isn’t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.” “Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Hermione. “He’s</P>
<P class="p874 ft9">the only one who realized there had been a swap!” “Yeah, but we could scarper before he <NOBR>realizes—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then <NOBR>double-cross</NOBR> him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards, Ron?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Ron’s ears had turned red.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your solution, then?”</P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.” “Brilliant, I’ll go and get one of our ancient <NOBR>goblin-made</NOBR> swords and you can</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">gift wrap it.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryfﬁndor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryfﬁndor; Gryfﬁndor had been the champion of <NOBR>Muggle-borns,</NOBR> the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood- loving Slytherin. . . .</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook. Maybe Gryfﬁndor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of his- tory’s right?”</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. “Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">He took a deep breath. ’</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">’We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get into that <NOBR>vault—but</NOBR> we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.”</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">A grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. “Harry, we <NOBR>can’t—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But that could be years!” said Hermione. “I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying. . . really.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">Harry met her eyes with a mixture of deﬁance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: F<SPAN class="ft24">OR THE </SPAN>G<SPAN class="ft24">REATER </SPAN>G<SPAN class="ft24">OOD</SPAN>. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have?</P>
<P class="p875 ft9">“I don’t like it,” said Hermione. “Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s go and tell him.”</P>
<P class="p254 ft14">Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any deﬁnite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the ﬂoor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry.</P>
<P class="p876 ft9">“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryfﬁndor if I help you?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Yes,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They set-</P>

<P class="p302 ft9">tled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook’s preference, in semidarkness.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .”</P>
<P class="p78 ft10">They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted.</P>
<P class="p78 ft9">“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight.</P>
<P class="p76 ft9">“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s <NOBR>hand-drawn</NOBR> map of the deepest passageways.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that some- thing was going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for meal- times. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned.</P>
<P class="p157 ft14">The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They needed Griphook.</P>
<P class="p852 ft10">The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the <NOBR>still—frail</NOBR> Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, in- sisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi.</P>
<P class="p69 ft9">Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her pre- pare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced behind her, her somewhat irritable expres- sion softened.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t need to be here much longer.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“But, what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course you must not leave, you are safe ’ere!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“. . . and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were</P>

<P class="p58 ft10">“. . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the ﬁre.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a <NOBR>Crumple-Horned</NOBR> <NOBR>Snorkack—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“No, it was deﬁnitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely, “Daddy told me. It will probably have <NOBR>re–formed</NOBR> by now, they mend themselves, you know.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exception- ally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.</P>
<P class="p59 ft2">“I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching the old man.</P>
<P class="p867 ft9">“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. “You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel!? I never returned ’er tiara.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wand- maker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the <NOBR>low-hanging</NOBR> lamp.</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander</P>

<P class="p62 ft14">set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The ﬁre crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had ﬁnished their ﬁrst course, his long hair tangled by the wind.</P>
<P class="p81 ft14">“Everything’s ﬁne,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an <NOBR>Owl-Order</NOBR> business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.”</P>
<P class="p81 ft10">“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room.</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna, “Well, more of a crown, really.” Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Yes, he’s trying to <NOBR>re-create</NOBR> the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he’s identiﬁed most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a <NOBR>difference—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Who is it?” Bill called.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? “I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the <NOBR>Secret-Keeper</NOBR> of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!”</P>
<P class="p877 ft9">“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. Lupin fell over the threshold. He was <NOBR>white-faced,</NOBR> wrapped in a traveling</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_439">


<P class="p40 ft2">439</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Hermione shrieked.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2"><NOBR>“Wha—?</NOBR> <NOBR>Tonks—Tonks</NOBR> has had the baby?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, “Congrat- ulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before.</P>
<P class="p283 ft10"><NOBR>“Yes—yes—a</NOBR> boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happi- ness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened.</P>
<P class="p42 ft2">“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. <NOBR>“M-me?”</NOBR> stammered Harry.</P>
<P class="p878 ft9">“You, yes, of <NOBR>course—Dora</NOBR> quite agrees, no one <NOBR>better—”</NOBR> <NOBR>“I—yeah—blimey—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.</P>
<P class="p190 ft11">“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you, thank you, Bill”</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">Bill had soon ﬁlled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast.</P>
<P class="p879 ft9">“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard in the making!” “’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to ﬁll it again.</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin’s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.</P>
<P class="p81 ft11">“No. . . no. . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself.</P>
<P class="p82 ft10"><NOBR>“Good-bye,</NOBR> <NOBR>good-bye—I’ll</NOBR> try and bring some pictures in a few day’s time— they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen <NOBR>you—”</NOBR> He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, help- ing clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the <NOBR>still-voluble</NOBR> voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Bill hesitated.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hog- warts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin <NOBR>friends—or,</NOBR> at least, goblins I know well, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_441">


<P class="p40 ft2">441</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">more empty goblets.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Wait,” Bill told her, “Just a moment.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">She backed out and he closed the door again.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“What do you mean?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill. “Dealings be- tween wizards and goblins have been fraught for <NOBR>centuries—but</NOBR> you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.”</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“I <NOBR>respect—”</NOBR> Harry began, but Bill shook his head.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.”</P>
<P class="p880 ft2">“But it was <NOBR>bought—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p57 ft10"><NOBR>“—then</NOBR> they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difﬁculty with the idea of <NOBR>goblin-made</NOBR> objects pass- ing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the ﬁercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original pur- chaser died. They consider our habit of keeping <NOBR>goblin-made</NOBR> objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.”</P>
<P class="p121 ft2">Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more</P>

<P class="p38 ft10">“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.” As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.</P>

<P class="p321 ft2">glass phial on the mantelpiece.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding toward the wal- nut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“I hate that thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me . . . It’s like a bit of her.”</P>
<P class="p881 ft10">Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice.

<P class="p34 ft2">wand that killed Sirius!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryfﬁndor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s problem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it per- sonally from Bellatrix.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached in- stinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, “We’ve just been checking the <NOBR>last-minute</NOBR> stuff, Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off.”</P>
<P class="p81 ft14">They had been ﬁrm on this point, because Hermione would need to trans- form in Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had also ex- plained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkin’s old tent on the night that the Snatcher’s caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stufﬁng it down her sock.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_445">


<P class="p68 ft2">445</P>
<P class="p617 ft11">to escaping the conﬁnement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bed- room. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryfﬁndor’s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossi- ble to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than ﬁve minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long ﬁngers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned <NOBR>double-cross</NOBR> that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it: Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few <NOBR>Griphook-free</NOBR> moments, had come up with nothing better than “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.”</P>
<P class="p852 ft11">Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had inﬁltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were <NOBR>well-prepared</NOBR> for all the difﬁculties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak.</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleep- ing bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound.</P>
<P class="p74 ft9">Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby’s grave now, in a year’s time the mound would be covered in ﬂowers.</P>

<P class="p312 ft11">The white stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His ﬁngers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, thorough which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look around.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix’s low voice.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you . . . .”</P>
<P class="p885 ft9">“right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long” “Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she trans- formed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">447</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">heavy eyebrows.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go, then?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t see a thing. Let’s go.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compress- ing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Ton, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his head subserviently.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the Inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Okay, okay!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, ﬁnally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly and shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his ﬁrst team at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new es- tablishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many win- dows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE.</P>
<P class="p52 ft10">A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moan- ing to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wiz- ards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. they seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and ﬂeeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“My children,” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high- pitched, he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2"><NOBR>“I-I</NOBR> <NOBR>really—”</NOBR> stammered Hermione.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of <NOBR>prosperous-looking</NOBR> passerby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_449">


<P class="p40 ft2">449</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Why, Madam Lestrange!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry’s neck: A tall, think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she could muster:</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“And what do you want?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence is not welcome . . . ”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Harry recognized his voice now: Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. “How are you?”</P>
<P class="p886 ft9">“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.” “Really? Why?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were conﬁned to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.”</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public—</P>
<P class="p485 ft10">“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a magniﬁcent imitation of Bellatrix’s most contemptu- ous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.” Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious.</P>
<P class="p887 ft9">He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. “How did it offend you?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione coolly.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers. “While they do</P>

I heard that your own <NOBR>was—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.”</P>
<P class="p888 ft9">Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. “Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided that a ﬁc- tional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. “He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Travers extended two ﬁngers and shook Ron’s hand as though frightened of dirtying himself.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">So what brings you and <NOBR>your—ah—sympathetic</NOBR> friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, ﬁlthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our <NOBR>long-ﬁngered</NOBR> friends.”</P>
<P class="p889 ft9">Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. “Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the <NOBR>snowy-white</NOBR> Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_451">


<P class="p40 ft2">451</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">there was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually ﬂanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods.</P>
<P class="p120 ft2">“Ah, Probity Probes,” signed Travers theatrically, “so <NOBR>crude—but</NOBR> so effec- tive!”</P>
<P class="p118 ft10">And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them.</P>
<P class="p890 ft10">Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. “One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s commanding, arro- gant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a <NOBR>knife-sharp</NOBR> memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal . . . .</P>
<P class="p891 ft9">But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the</P>
<P class="p674 ft10">ﬁrst customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Hermione stepped forward.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear me!” How- how may I help you today?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“You have . . . identiﬁcation?” asked the goblin.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Identiﬁcation? <NOBR>I-I</NOBR> have never been asked for identiﬁcation before!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “They must have been warned there might be an imposter!”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a slightly trem- bling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen.</P>
<P class="p892 ft9">“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Imperious Curse!” Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">goblin, and whispered, for the ﬁrst time in his life, “Imperio!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to ﬂow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix’s wand, ex-</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">453</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">amined it closely, and then said, “Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“What?” said Hermione, “No, no, that’s <NOBR>mine—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the gob- lins all around were watching. “But how could you have done, which wand- maker did you use?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, “Imperio!” once more.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little break- ing in, don’t you?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous relief she ac- cepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away and re- turned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanish- ing from sight. “I shall take you to your vault.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“Wait—Bogrod!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.</P>
<P class="p893 ft10">“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “Forgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">him off.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault</P>

<P class="p86 ft14">And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision. With a ﬂick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with ﬂaming torches.</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know . . . ”</P>
<P class="p894 ft10">And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had ﬁrst tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we can?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.”</P>
<P class="p895 ft9">Harry pointed his wand at Travers. “Imperio!”</P>
<P class="p896 ft9">The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. “What are you making him do?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to sum- mon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_455">


<P class="p40 ft2">455</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">Hermione crammed together in the back.</P>
<P class="p57 ft11">With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair ﬂew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, ﬂying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enor- mous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bella- trix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it—</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking. They zoomed through it. Water ﬁlled Harry’s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart ﬂipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10"><NOBR>“C-Cushioning</NOBR> Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was <NOBR>red-haired</NOBR> and beardless again. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hur- riedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilder-</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">ment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to have lifted his Imperius Curse.</P>
<P class="p897 ft9">“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott’s goblin. And we need the clankers!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that ﬂowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!” They saw the Shield Charm break the ﬂow of enchanted water as it ﬂew up the passageway.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was trying to lis- ten: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. “Griphook, how much farther?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Not far, Harry Potter, not far. . . “</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been pre- pared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.</P>
<P class="p30 ft14">A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring ac- cess to four or ﬁve of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast’s scales had turned pale and ﬂaky during its long incarceration under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky ﬂoor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have ﬁlled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of ﬁre that sent them running back up the passageway.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_457">


<P class="p40 ft2">457</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magniﬁed, so that the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the den. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.</P>
<P class="p218 ft12">“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike open- ing crammed from ﬂoor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange <NOBR>creatures—some</NOBR> with long spines, other with drooping <NOBR>wings-potions</NOBR> in jeweled ﬂasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. “Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Huf- ﬂepuff’s cap to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a mufﬂed clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness.</P>
<P class="p358 ft11">“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have little time!”</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“Lumos!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryfﬁndor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now</P>

But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the ﬂoor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them.</P>
<P class="p898 ft10">“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered ﬁngers. “They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook. “Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless—</P>
<P class="p350 ft9">and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two <NOBR>handles—otherwise</NOBR> see if you can spot Raven- claw’s symbol anywhere, the <NOBR>eagle—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft11">They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the gob- lets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wand- light passed over shields and <NOBR>goblin-made</NOBR> helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“It’s there, it’s up there!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a <NOBR>three-way</NOBR> spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Huf-</P>

<P class="p268 ft9">ﬂepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her despera- tion what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more <NOBR>than—wait!</NOBR> Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft12">Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver ﬂagon nearby, which did not multiply.</P>
<P class="p286 ft9">“If I can just poke the sword through a <NOBR>handle—but</NOBR> how am I going to get up there?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“Hermione,” said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p322 ft9">She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levicorpus.” Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas</P>
<P class="p257 ft10">burst out of it like <NOBR>white-hot</NOBR> bodies, ﬁlling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of <NOBR>red-hot</NOBR></P>

<P class="p39 ft9">“Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long ﬁngers were left in view.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Harry seized Griphook’s ﬁngers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Liberatocorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword ﬂew out of Harry’s hand.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Get it!” Harry yelled, ﬁghting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of <NOBR>red-hot</NOBR> objects. “Where’s the sword? It had the cup on it!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">The clanking on the other side of the door was growing <NOBR>deafening—it</NOBR> was too late—</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“There!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a ﬁstful of Harry’s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry’s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade was ﬂung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his ﬂesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufﬂepuff cups burst from his ﬁst, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of ﬁery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_461">


<P class="p40 ft2">461</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!” He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light ﬂew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of ﬂame ﬂew over the goblins; The wizards ﬂed, <NOBR>doubled-up,</NOBR> back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the ﬂoor, he yelled, “Relashio!”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">The cuffs broken open with loud bangs.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advanc- ing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon.</P>
<P class="p899 ft9"><NOBR>“Harry—Harry—what</NOBR> are you doing?” cried Hermione. “Get up, climb up, come <NOBR>on—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p192 ft10">The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, ﬂat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its ﬂanks.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched ﬂame again, blasting the tunnel, whose ﬂoors</P>

<P class="p900 ft10">and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodio!”</P>
<P class="p101 ft14">She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawl- ing, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more mufﬂed, while ahead, the dragon’s ﬁre kept their progress clear—</P>
<P class="p177 ft11">And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hall- way. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and ﬁnally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Di- agon Alley and launched itself into the sky.</P>

<P class="p95 ft4">The Final Hiding Place</P>
<P class="p383 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>here was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would ﬁnd it impossible to cling onto its broad back.</P>
<P class="p158 ft11">Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a <NOBR>gray-and-green</NOBR> map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell. Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">After ﬁve minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could ﬂy without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his seat prickling.</P>
<P class="p236 ft9">How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix?</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes.</P>
<P class="p31 ft14">The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily until they were ﬂying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they ﬂew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they ﬂew farther and farther north.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“No idea,” Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not date attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open seal he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon ﬂew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the pres- ence of fresh water by the ﬂashes of reﬂected sunlight.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Lower and lower the dragon ﬂew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the others.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_465">


<P class="p348 ft2">465</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“NOW!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetﬁrst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, <NOBR>reed-ﬁlled</NOBR> world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already ﬁfty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon ﬂew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did not seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of ﬁghting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they ﬂopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">When he had ﬁnished, he joined the others. It was the ﬁrst time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changes and then gulped down the juice.</P>
<P class="p127 ft9">“Well, on the upside,” said Ron ﬁnally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the <NOBR>downside—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p903 ft9"><NOBR>“—no</NOBR> sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That <NOBR>double-crossing</NOBR> little scab. . . ”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging around our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked, “Will it be alright?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron, “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Well I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difﬁcult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione ﬁnally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> will know we know about his Horcruxes!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him!” said Ron hopefully, “Maybe they’ll cover <NOBR>up—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were extin- guished. Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the ﬂoor at his feet knelt a small, quaking ﬁgure.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing that he had <NOBR>dreaded—but</NOBR> it could not be true, he could not see how. . .</P>
<P class="p904 ft9">The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. “Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_467">


<P class="p40 ft2">467</P>
<P class="p119 ft10"><NOBR>“M-my</NOBR> Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, “m- my Lord. . . we <NOBR>t-tried</NOBR> to <NOBR>st-stop</NOBR> them. . . <NOBR>Im-impostors,</NOBR> my Lord. . . <NOBR>broke—broke</NOBR> into <NOBR>the—into</NOBR> the Lestranges’ vault. . . ”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">”Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were they?</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“It was. . . it was. . . the <NOBR>P-Potter</NOBR> <NOBR>b-boy</NOBR> and the <NOBR>t-two</NOBR> accomplices. . . ”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, “Tell me! What did they take?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“A. . . a <NOBR>s-small</NOBR> golden <NOBR>c-cup</NOBR> <NOBR>m-my</NOBR> Lord. . . ”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s. He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had known. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?</P>
<P class="p42 ft14">The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terriﬁed. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup—</P>
<P class="p60 ft14">Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to <NOBR>immortality—the</NOBR> diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy—</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Volde- mort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?</P>

<P class="p905 ft10">True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost. . . . No, surely, the rest were safe. . . The other Horcruxes must be intact. . . .</P>
<P class="p176 ft10">But he must know, he must be sure. . . He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts—</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">A modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe.</P>
<P class="p100 ft9">And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd. . . .</P>
<P class="p176 ft9">As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place. . .</P>
<P class="p174 ft9">And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . .</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone. . .</P>
<P class="p173 ft10">Which should he visit ﬁrst, which was in most danger? An old unease ﬂick- ered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name. . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts. . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go ﬁrst. . . .</P>
<P class="p109 ft10">The lake, surely impossible. . . though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the or- phanage.</P>
<P class="p188 ft10">And Hogwarts. . . but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. . . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return</P>

<DIV id="page_469">


<P class="p40 ft2">469</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy. Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?</P>
<P class="p48 ft12">He would visit the Gaunt shack ﬁrst, then, and take Nagini with him. He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . .</P>
<P class="p60 ft11">Harry’s eyes ﬂew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the contin- ued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s high screams. “He knows and he’s going to check where the others are, and the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What?”</P>
<P class="p400 ft9">Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. “But what did you see? How do you know?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“I saw him ﬁnd out about the cup, <NOBR>I-I</NOBR> was in his head, <NOBR>he’s”—Harry</NOBR> remem- bered the <NOBR>killings—“he’s</NOBR> seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring ﬁrst. He things the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within <NOBR>hours—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p182 ft9">“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about exactly where it <NOBR>is—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“We need to get going,” said Harry ﬁrmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, ”Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“But how are we going to get in?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“But we don’t really <NOBR>ﬁt—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The ﬂapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon had drunk its ﬁll and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.</P>

<P class="p906 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">H</SPAN>arry’s feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black moun- tains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led</P>
<P class="p442 ft10">off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broom- sticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon <NOBR>landing—and</NOBR> then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters</P>
<P class="p907 ft2">Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning 471</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">Charm had not worked on it.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. “Spread now. He’s here.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light ﬂying along the street from the Death Eaters’ searching wands.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”</P>
<P class="p910 ft10">“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, “We know you are here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll ﬁnd you!” “They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to tell</P>
<P class="p911 ft9">them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap <NOBR>us—”</NOBR> “What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let’em have free</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">rein, they’d ﬁnd him quick enough!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but <NOBR>his—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p227 ft9"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">’an dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, nor his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed ﬁrst!”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p39 ft11">There were noises of agreement. Dread ﬁlled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immedi- ately.</P>
<P class="p420 ft9">“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered. Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street.</P>
<P class="p314 ft10">Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s ﬂesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_473">


<P class="p40 ft2">473</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in—</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered “Expecto Patronum!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the <NOBR>left-side</NOBR> of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: “Potter, in here, quick!”</P>
<P class="p119 ft9">He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall ﬁgure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small ﬁreplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what? You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at’em! I’m not hav- ing’em near me, I’ve told you that. I’m not having it!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“That wasn’t your Patronus,” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag. It was Potter’s!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You idiot— Expecto Patronum!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“That’s not what I saw” said the Death Eater, though was less certainly “Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">barman. “Someone was out on the streets against <NOBR>regulations—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p912 ft9">“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!” “You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Don’t worry about us.” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“And where will you lot trafﬁc potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Are you <NOBR>threatening—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p913 ft9">“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the ﬁrst Death Eater. “Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater. “Break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a <NOBR>wobble-legged</NOBR> chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They</P>
</DIV>

<P class="p40 ft2">475</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">The barman entered the room.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You bloody fools,” he said grufﬂy, looking from one to the other of them. “What were you thinking, coming here?”</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“Thank you,” said Harry. “You can’t thank you enough. You saved our lives!” The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: try- ing to see past the long, stringy, <NOBR>wire-gray</NOBR> hair beard. He wore spectacles.</P>
<P class="p914 ft9">Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. “It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”</P>
<P class="p310 ft2">There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other.</P>
<P class="p403 ft2">“You sent Dobby.”</P>
<P class="p915 ft9">The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. ”Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“He’s dead,” said Harry, “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.”</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">He neither conﬁrmed or denied it, but bent to light the ﬁre.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.</P>
<P class="p382 ft9">“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Ron gasped.</P>
<P class="p916 ft9">“The silver doe,” he said excitedly, “Was that you too?” “What are you talking about?” asked Aberforth.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just prove my Patronus is a goat?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Oh,” said Ron, “Yeah. . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the ﬁre. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">“Right then,” said Aberforth when the had eaten their ﬁll and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.”</P>
<P class="p917 ft9">“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.” “Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“We’ve got to,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get as far from here as from here as you can.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the castle. <NOBR>Dumbledore—I</NOBR> mean, your <NOBR>brother—wanted</NOBR> <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The ﬁrelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright ﬂat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the gi- ant spider, Aragog.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_477">


<P class="p40 ft2">477</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him anything.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You don’t understand.” said Harry again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Oh, don’t I? said Aberforth quietly. ”You don’t think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s. . . he left me a job.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an unqualiﬁed wizard kid to be able to do without over- stretching themselves?”</P>
<P class="p918 ft9">Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. <NOBR>“I—it’s</NOBR> not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”</P>
<P class="p919 ft9">“I can’t.” “Why not?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9"><NOBR>“I—”</NOBR> Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. “But you’re ﬁghting too, you’re in the Order of the <NOBR>Phoenix—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is ﬁnished. <NOBR>You-Know-</NOBR> Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding them- selves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.”</P>
<P class="p920 ft9">“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a <NOBR>job—”</NOBR> “Give it to someone else!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it <NOBR>all—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p893 ft10">“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?” Harry wanted him with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the sim- ple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">thinking.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus. . . he was a natural.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">“Mr. Dumbledore” said Hermione rather timidly. ”Is that your sister? Ari- ana?</P>
<P class="p921 ft10">“Yes.” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?” Even by the rosy light of the ﬁre it was clear that Hermione had turned red. “Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. “That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every ofﬁce, he did. Well, so did plenty of peo-</P>
<P class="p515 ft2">ple, you three included, by the looks of it.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to continue along the wind- ing, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would de- ﬂect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers’: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were <NOBR>X-raying</NOBR> the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Hermione in a low voice.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em well alone.”</P>
<P class="p922 ft9">“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly. “Never you mind,” said Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are <NOBR>you—are</NOBR> you</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_479">


<P class="p40 ft2">479</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">talking about your sister?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">Hermione’s eyes were huge in the ﬁrelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aber- forth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the inten- sity of his pain.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">”It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, ”and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer.</P>
<P class="p60 ft9">”We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“I was her favourite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and wrangled beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and count- ing his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable mag- ical names of the day,”’ Aberforth succored. “He didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Then, when she was fourteen. . . See, I wasn’t there.” said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.</P>
<P class="p236 ft10">“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Aberforth spat into the ﬁre.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to ﬁnish my education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your <NOBR>half-mad</NOBR> sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.”</P>
<P class="p733 ft9">And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. “Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just</P>
<P class="p674 ft10">as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the beneﬁt of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em, <NOBR>face-to-face,</NOBR> like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no ﬁt state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re making</P>

<P class="p56 ft11">your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn’t like that.” said Aberforth, and his eyes were brieﬂy occluded by the ﬁreﬂight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. ”Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend— and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the ﬂashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p59 ft9">The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of <NOBR>us—and</NOBR> she was dead.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it.</P>
<P class="p923 ft9">“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered. “Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of </SPAN><NOBR>the—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“He was never free,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">who wasn’t there. ’Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.’ ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. “He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.”</P>
<P class="p726 ft10">Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. “How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. ”Why didn’t he say to him, ’Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’ ?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“You’re seventeen, boy!”</P>
<P class="p924 ft9">“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep ﬁghting even if you’ve given up!” “Who says I’ve given up?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“The Order of the Phoenix is ﬁnished,” Harry repeated, <NOBR>“You-Know-Who’s</NOBR> won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“No, it isn’t.” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to ﬁnish <NOBR>You-Know-</NOBR> Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until I <NOBR>succeed—or</NOBR> I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.”</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_483">


<P class="p40 ft2">483</P>
<P class="p925 ft10">“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to ﬁnd a way in ourselves. If you can help <NOBR>us—well,</NOBR> now would be a great time to mention it.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">Aberforth remained ﬁxed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“You know what to do,” he said.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight ﬁgure retreating until ﬁnally she was swallowed by the darkness.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><NOBR>“Er—what—?”</NOBR> began Ron.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies. . . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.”</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture.</P>
<P class="p190 ft11">A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ar- iana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two ﬁgures grew, until only their heads and shoulders ﬁlled the portrait. Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clam- bered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. “I knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!”</P>

<P class="p159 ft2">“Neville, what’s happened to you?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. “This is nothing, Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caurwauling Charm on the whole village!”</P>
<P class="p453 ft11">“I know, that’s why the’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you?

<P class="p34 ft2">Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth grufﬂy. “I might not be able to save ’em a third time.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hold behind Ar- iana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the outside: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy ﬂoor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of the school?”</P>
<P class="p928 ft11">“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville. “There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the en- trances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. . . . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s ev- erywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Teddy Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”</P>
<P class="p929 ft9">“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry. Neville laughed gleefully,</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“What did you do with the dragon?”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a <NOBR>pet—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Don’t exaggerate, <NOBR>Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“You’re right,” said Harry. “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“It’s been. . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_487">


<P class="p40 ft2">487</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Like Umbridge?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us the the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned <NOBR>detentions—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What?”</P>
<P class="p594 ft11">Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the passage. “Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect. “Alecto, Amycus’ sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for ev- eryone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious to- ward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,” he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking how much Muggle blood she</P>
<P class="p198 ft2">and her brother have got.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">the <NOBR>matter-of-fact</NOBR> tone in which he said them.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen <NOBR>her—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Yeah, I know, she managed to met a message to me.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another messages.</P>
<P class="p352 ft10">“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put grafﬁti on the walls: Dumbledore’s Army, Still Re- cruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Well, it got more difﬁcult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of leaders. The Carrows seemed to know that I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a <NOBR>ﬁrst-year</NOBR> they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.”</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still ﬁghting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnap- ping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_489">


<P class="p40 ft2">489</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living along,e the probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.”</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“Cool,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over e, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, <NOBR>“aren’t—aren’t</NOBR> we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short ﬂight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ari- ana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people:</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermione!”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair rufﬂed, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch ﬁnal.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and rather looked like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark <NOBR>wood-paneled</NOBR> and windowless walls, which</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryfﬁndor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufﬂepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large <NOBR>wooden-cased</NOBR> wireless.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Where are we?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryfﬁndor hangings, But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.”</P>
<P class="p930 ft9">“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around for the door. “No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke:</P>
<P class="p674 ft10">Seamus’ face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you <NOBR>need—like,</NOBR> “I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get <NOBR>in—and</NOBR> it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Yea, well, food’s one of the ﬁve exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transﬁguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus, “and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning <NOBR>up—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_491">


<P class="p40 ft2">491</P>
<P class="p189 ft9">were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. “Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve been so many</P>
<P class="p270 ft9">rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch,” He pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”</P>
<P class="p931 ft9">There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. “What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside some shack, an the rotting ﬂoorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, <NOBR>aren’t—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them with- out words that Voldemort has just discovered the loss of one of the other Hor- cruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“We need to get going,” he said, and their expression told him that they understood.</P>
<P class="p482 ft10">“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s the plan?” “Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent him- self succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning. “Well, there’s something <NOBR>we—Ron,</NOBR> Hermione, and <NOBR>I—need</NOBR> to do, and then we’ll get</P>
<P class="p461 ft2">out of here.”</P>
<P class="p932 ft9">Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. “What d’you mean, ’get out of here’?”</P>

<P class="p38 ft10">The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some enthusias- tically, other solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“You don’t understand,” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. <NOBR>“We—we</NOBR> can’t tell you. We’ve got to do <NOBR>it—alone.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Why?” asked Neville.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">“Because. . . ” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difﬁcult to gather his thoughts; His scar was still searing. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to <NOBR>tell—I</NOBR> mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.”</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it to- gether, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own—</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in this room’s been ﬁghting and they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore— loyal to you.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: the tunnel door had just opened behind him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_493">


<P class="p40 ft2">493</P>
<P class="p195 ft2">“We got your message, Neville! Hello, you three, I thought you must be here!”</P>
<P class="p363 ft9">It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Luna,” said Harry distractingly, “what are you doing here? How did you—</P>
<P class="p329 ft2">?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft9">“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly, “Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to ﬁght them out of Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and <NOBR>then—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael Corner.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will beneﬁt everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of <NOBR>You-Know-Who—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His head seemed to fall: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less please to see her.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girl- friend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so ﬁercely.</P>
<P class="p31 ft2">“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,” said Fred.</P>
<P class="p254 ft9">“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call them all back for? This is <NOBR>insane—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“We’re ﬁghting aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. “The message said Harry was back, and we were going to ﬁght! I’ll have to get a wand, <NOBR>though—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p933 ft9">“You haven’t got a <NOBR>wand—?”</NOBR> began Seamus. Ron turned suddenly to Harry.</P>
<P class="p934 ft9">“Why can’t they help?” “What?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between then, “We don’t know where it is, We’ve got to ﬁnd it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus. . . he was a natural. . . Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower. . .</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the beneﬁt of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“There’s something we need to ﬁnd,” Harry said. <NOBR>“Something—something</NOBR></P>

<P class="p316 ft12">that’ll help us overthrow <NOBR>You-Know-Who.</NOBR> It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?”</P>
<P class="p935 ft11">He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny’s chair.</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“Well, that’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“When was it lost?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws. “nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?”</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">They all shook their heads.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”</P>
<P class="p936 ft9">“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt <NOBR>siphons—”</NOBR> But Harry cut across Luna.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the caste. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.”</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was ﬂying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know; Either way, there was hardly any time left.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron ad Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least ﬁnd out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you <NOBR>know—the</NOBR> other <NOBR>one—safe,”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather ﬁercely, “No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.</P>
<P class="p937 ft9">“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville. “Over here.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">He lead Harry and Luna into a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a staircase.</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to ﬁnd it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.”</P>
<P class="p781 ft2">“No problem.” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark cor- ridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his nose he</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_497">


<P class="p40 ft2">497</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">search, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“We’re up on the ﬁfth ﬂoor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">They crept off.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never has his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended oh his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the ﬂoor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around cor- ners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the ﬁrst, telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him to- ward a spiral staircase.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie ﬂoating in midair, un- connected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence, it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft musical voice said, “Which came ﬁrst, the phoenix or the ﬂame?”</P>
<P class="p938 ft9">“Hmm. . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful. “What? Isn’t there just a password?”</P>
<P class="p939 ft9">“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna. “What if you get it wrong?”</P>
<P class="p310 ft9">“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna. “That way you learn, you see?”</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">“Yeah. . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.” “No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I think the</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">answer is that a circle has no beginning.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful etched windows punc- tuated the walls, which were hung with <NOBR>blue-and-bronze</NOBR> silks; By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight- blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A <NOBR>delicate-looking</NOBR> circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.</P>
<P class="p92 ft2">“’Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the ﬂoor. The <NOBR>sloping-shouldered</NOBR> ﬁgure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby foreﬁnger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.</P>

<P class="p691 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>he moment her ﬁnger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar burned sav- agely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an overcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing</P>
<P class="p321 ft2">around him and there was triumph in his <NOBR>heart—They</NOBR> have the boy.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought it would be.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, ﬂooded into the common room. There were gasps and cries o surprise as they say Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shufﬂed in</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little <NOBR>ﬁrst-year</NOBR> darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. “They’re pleased!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Yeah. . . great. . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind. . . . He was moving along the tunnel into the ﬁrst cave. . . .</P>
<P class="p203 ft9">He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming. . . but that would not take him long. . . .</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terriﬁed. Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was ﬁring a gun into the door.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got <NOBR>Potter—d’you</NOBR> want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast the door open and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.</P>
<P class="p237 ft2">“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9"><NOBR>“Trying—to</NOBR> <NOBR>get—through</NOBR> this <NOBR>damned—door!”</NOBR> shouted Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall. “Didn’t Pro-</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">501</P>
<P class="p519 ft9">fessor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at you urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half the castle.”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!” “Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness.</P>
<P class="p940 ft9">There was a gentle tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again. “Where do Vanished objects go?”</P>
<P class="p736 ft10">“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything.” replied Professor McGonagall. “Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto,</P>
<P class="p515 ft2">sprawled motionless on the ﬂoor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did <NOBR>it—and</NOBR> what’s the Dark Lord going to say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his ﬁst, “We haven’t got him, and they’ve gone and killed her!”</P>
<P class="p941 ft9">“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Got Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do you mean, ’got Potter’?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.</P>
<P class="p222 ft9">“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno why, do I?” Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.</P>
<P class="p942 ft14">“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, then kids up <NOBR>there”—he</NOBR> looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories— “and we’ll say they forced her to press the Mark, and that’s why he got a false alarm. . . . He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what’s the differ- ence?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“Excuse me?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGona- gall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. You time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">And he spat in her face.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter— you’re here! <NOBR>What—?How—?”</NOBR> She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_503">


<P class="p40 ft2">503</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">that was foolish!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“He spat at you,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Potter, <NOBR>I—that</NOBR> was <NOBR>very—very</NOBR> gallant of <NOBR>you—but</NOBR> don’t you <NOBR>realize—?”</NOBR> “Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. “Profes-</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">sor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told Luna. “He already knows where I am.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood. . . .</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“You must ﬂee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“The <NOBR>d—diadem</NOBR> of Ravenclaw? Of course <NOBR>not—hasn’t</NOBR> it been lost for cen- turies?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this <NOBR>castle—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m supposed to ﬁnd, and it could be the <NOBR>diadem—if</NOBR> i could just speak to Professor <NOBR>Flitwick—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming around. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointing her want at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shufﬂed obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the ﬂoor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament. “if <NOBR>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named</NOBR> does indeed know that you are <NOBR>here—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft12">As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on ﬁre, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface—</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must ﬁnd what he wanted me to ﬁnd! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the <NOBR>castle—It’s</NOBR> me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not <NOBR>now—”’</NOBR> not now he knows I’m attacking Horcruxes. Harry ﬁnished the sentence in his head.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“We shall secure the school against <NOBR>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named</NOBR> while you search for <NOBR>this—this</NOBR> object.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Is that possible?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put out best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor <NOBR>Snape—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Let <NOBR>me—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> if Hogwarts is about to enter a stage of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the <NOBR>grounds—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_505">


<P class="p40 ft2">505</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of <NOBR>students—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparat- ing out of Hog’s Head.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Car- rows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the <NOBR>blue-and-gold</NOBR> ceil- ing like two large, ugly sea creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, ﬁlling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the ﬂoor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">They had descended two more ﬂoors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs, Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them ﬁrst. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company, She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">“It is I,” said a low voice.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the details of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a ﬁght.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor McGona- gall.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">Snape stopped nearer, and his eyes ﬂitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held up his wand tip too, ready to attack.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had apprehended an intruder.”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that impression?” Snape made a slight ﬂexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">was branded into his skin.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eaters have you own private means of communication, I forgot.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.</P>
<P class="p943 ft9">“I did not know that it was you night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.” “You have some objection?”</P>
<P class="p944 ft10">“I wonder what could have brought you out of you bed at this hour?” “I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall. “Really? But all seems calm.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Snape looked into her eyes.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist—</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it ﬂew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending ﬂames, which became a ring of ﬁre that ﬁlled the corridor and ﬂew like a lasso at Snape—</P>
<P class="p945 ft10">Then it was no longer ﬁre, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which <NOBR>re-formed</NOBR> and solidiﬁed in seconds to become a swarm of pur- suing daggers. Snape avoided them only be forcing the suit of armor in front</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">507</P>
<P class="p316 ft9">of him, and with echoing clang, the dagger sank, one after another, into the breast—</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from ﬂying spells, Harry saw Professor Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in the nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">“No!” squeaking Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do more murder at Hogwarts!”</P>
<P class="p272 ft11">Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snap had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it ﬂying back toward his attackers; Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full ﬂight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thunder- ing after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room.</P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“You means he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">“no, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand. . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.”</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape ﬂying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.</P>
<P class="p502 ft9">There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of pufﬁng: Slughorn had just caught up.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-</P>

<P class="p39 ft12">“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the <NOBR>Inferi-ﬁlled</NOBR> lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart—</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Professor, we’ve got the barricade the school, he’s coming now!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“Very well. <NOBR>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named</NOBR> is coming,” she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.”</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You- <NOBR>Know-Who</NOBR> indeﬁnitely?” said Professor Sprout.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and ﬁght, I think they ought to be given the chance.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, “Tentacula, Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pod. . . yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters ﬁght- ing those.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could bare see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Professor,</P>

<P class="p268 ft9">I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10"><NOBR>“—Protego</NOBR> <NOBR>Horribilis—the</NOBR> diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“I only <NOBR>meant—do</NOBR> you know where it is? Have you seen it?”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, my boy!” Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then,</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">was the Horcrux?</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. “What a <NOBR>to-do!</NOBR> I’m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to ﬁnd a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous <NOBR>peril—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Minerva!” he said, aghast.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,” inter- rupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your students, Horace.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after Pro- fessor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2"><NOBR>“Piertotum—oh,</NOBR> for heaven’s sake, Filch, not <NOBR>now—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“They’re supposed to be here, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGonagall. “Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft2"><NOBR>“P—Peeves?”</NOBR> stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before.</P>
<P class="p271 ft9">“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!”</P>
<P class="p946 ft9">Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, <NOBR>hunch-shouldered,</NOBR> muttering under his breath.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“And <NOBR>now—Piertotum</NOBR> Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the ﬂoors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “May the bound- aries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry some of them smaller, some of them larger, than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better re- turn to you friends and bring them to the Great <NOBR>Hall—I</NOBR> shall rouse the other Gryfﬁndors.”</P>
<P class="p82 ft10">They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, be- ing shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.</P>
<P class="p947 ft9">“That was Potter!” “Harry Potter!”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2"><NOBR>“Wh—?”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p268 ft9">and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p43 ft2">“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs.</P>
<P class="p867 ft9">“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the <NOBR>school—Snape’s</NOBR> run for it— What are you doing here? How did you know?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What ﬁrst, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re ﬁghting.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs, he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry ap- proached. “I won’t permit it! They boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to get home!”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“I won’t!”</P>
<P class="p948 ft9">Ginny’s hair ﬂew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip. “I’m in Dumbledore’s <NOBR>Army—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“A teenagers’ gang!”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one she has dared to do!” said Fred.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Everyone under- age will have to leave, it’s only right.”</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing <NOBR>and—”</NOBR> Her eyes met Harry’s for the ﬁrst time. She looked at him beseechingly, but</P>
<P class="p250 ft2">he shook his head and she turned away bitterly,</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say <NOBR>good-bye</NOBR> now, then, <NOBR>and—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p123 ft10">There was a scufﬂing and a great thump: Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided <NOBR>horn-rimmed</NOBR> glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so <NOBR>I—I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, <NOBR>“So—’ow</NOBR> eez leetle Teddy?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to by solidifying, like ice.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9"><NOBR>“I—oh</NOBR> <NOBR>yes—he’s</NOBR> ﬁne!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with <NOBR>him—at</NOBR> her <NOBR>mother’s—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p228 ft9">Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. “Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside</P>
<P class="p356 ft9">his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat ﬁsts at the camera.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photo- graph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was <NOBR>a—a—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p949 ft9"><NOBR>“Ministry-loving,</NOBR> <NOBR>family-disowning,</NOBR> <NOBR>power-hungry</NOBR> moron.” said Fred. Percy swallowed.</P>

<P class="p45 ft11">Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“I’m sorry, Dad.” Percy said.</P>
<P class="p950 ft9">Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. “What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to ﬁnd a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a ﬁght for it, so here I am.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,” said George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and ﬁght, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“So, you’re my <NOBR>sister-in-law</NOBR> now?” said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Ginny has been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak up- stairs too.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be in the middle of the ﬁghting?”</P>

<P class="p45 ft9">“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley ﬁrmly. “Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?”</P>

<P class="p93 ft2">“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long after you left.”</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“A bathroom?”</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Re- quirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You’re sure that they said <NOBR>bath—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was looking through the high <NOBR>wrought-iron</NOBR> gates with winded boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.</P>

<P class="p288 ft4">The Battle of Hogwarts</P>
<P class="p951 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>he enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with di- sheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns.</P>
<P class="p442 ft10">Here and there shone the pearly white ﬁgures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was ﬁxed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Or- der of the Phoenix who had arrived to ﬁght.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10"><NOBR>“—evacuation</NOBR> will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Many of the students looked petriﬁed. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryfﬁndor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufﬂepuff table and shouted. “And what if we want to stay and ﬁght?”</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">There was a smattering of applause.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. “Our trunks, our owls?”</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall. “The</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">important thing is to get you out of here safely.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGo- nagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryfﬁndors, Hufﬂepuffs, and Raven- claws.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryfﬁndor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he paused, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake.</P>
<P class="p315 ft10">“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGona- gall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and so as your <NOBR>prefects—”</NOBR> But her ﬁnal words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clean. There was no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once</P>
<P class="p954 ft2">commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“I know you are preparing to ﬁght.” There were screams amongst the stu- dents, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot ﬁght me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.”</P>
<P class="p94 ft9">There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you should be rewarded.</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">“You have until midnight.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a ﬁgure rose from the Slytherin table and he recog- nized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_517">


<P class="p40 ft2">517</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryfﬁndors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufﬂepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them, with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, <NOBR>awe-struck</NOBR> and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and under sleeves.</P>
<P class="p182 ft11">“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall ﬁrst with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.”</P>
<P class="p748 ft9">Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely de- serted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows ﬁled out; even more Hufﬂepuffs stayed behind, and half of remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ plat- form to chivvy the underage on their way.</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft2">Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryfﬁndor table.</P>
<P class="p403 ft2">“Where are Ron and Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Haven’t you <NOBR>found—?”</NOBR> began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A bat- tle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of ﬁghters up to the three highest <NOBR>towers—Ravenclaw,</NOBR> Astronomy, and <NOBR>Gryfﬁndor—where</NOBR> they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells.

<P class="p39 ft9">“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“All right, leaders up hear and we’ll divide up the troops!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students ﬂooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind.</P>
<P class="p955 ft9">“Then go, Potter, go!” <NOBR>“Right—yeah—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft11">He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on ﬁnding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . .</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explana- tion: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_519">


<P class="p40 ft2">519</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">that house.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">In living memory . . . .</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Beneath his ﬁngers, Harry’s eyes ﬂew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching towards the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over ﬁrst years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings . . . .</P>
<P class="p119 ft9">Harry caught sight of a pearly white ﬁgure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">He forced his way back through the tide of students, ﬁnally reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryfﬁndor Tower, stood waiting for him.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Harry! My dear boy!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.</P>
<P class="p956 ft9">“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.</P>
<P class="p957 ft9">“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you <NOBR>require—?”</NOBR> “It’s got to be <NOBR>her—d’you</NOBR> know where she is?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Let’s see . . . .”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing ﬁnger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2"><NOBR>“Hey—wait—come</NOBR> back!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">She consented to pause, ﬂoating a few inches from the ground. Harry sup- posed that she was beautiful, with her <NOBR>waist-length</NOBR> hair and <NOBR>ﬂoor-length</NOBR> cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“You’re the Gray Lady?”</P>
<P class="p958 ft10">She nodded but did not speak. “The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” “That is correct.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Her tone was not encouraging.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">A cold smile curved her lips.</P>
<P class="p959 ft9">“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.” “WAIT!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to over- whelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“This is urgent,” he said ﬁercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to ﬁnd it, fast.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“You are hardly the ﬁrst student to covet the diadem,” she said disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered <NOBR>me—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her. “It’s about <NOBR>Voldemort—defeating</NOBR> <NOBR>Voldemort—or</NOBR> aren’t you interested in that?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_521">


<P class="p40 ft2">521</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course <NOBR>I—how</NOBR> dare you <NOBR>suggest—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Well, help me, then!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Her composure was slipping.</P>
<P class="p960 ft9"><NOBR>“It—it</NOBR> is not a question <NOBR>of—”</NOBR> she stammered. “My mother’s <NOBR>diadem—”</NOBR> “Your mother’s?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">She looked angry with herself.</P>
<P class="p414 ft2">“When I lived,” she said stifﬂy, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!” “While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull</P>
<P class="p270 ft9">herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeat- ing the wizard who calls himself <NOBR>Lord—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft12">“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry said ﬁercely. “There’s no time to <NOBR>explain—but</NOBR> if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort ﬁnished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!”</P>
<P class="p102 ft12">She remained quite still, ﬂoating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.</P>
<P class="p961 ft9">“I stole the diadem from my mother.” <NOBR>“You—you</NOBR> did what?”</P>
<P class="p180 ft10">“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a in a whisper. “I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.” He did not know how he had managed to gain her conﬁdence and did not</P>
<P class="p196 ft2">ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pre- tended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Then my mother fell <NOBR>ill-fatally</NOBR> ill. In spite of my perﬁdy, she was desperate</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to ﬁnd me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a <NOBR>hot-tempered</NOBR> man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“The Baron? You <NOBR>mean—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“And . . . and the diadem?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother’s reach.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confu- sion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">She closed her eyes and nodded.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . ﬂattering. He seemed to . . . to understand</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">. . . to sympathize . . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Well, you weren’t the ﬁrst person Riddle wormed things out of,” Harry mut- tered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_523">


<P class="p40 ft2">523</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that <NOBR>far-ﬂung</NOBR> forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undis- turbed, for ten long years?</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there—</P>
<P class="p962 ft9"><NOBR>“—the</NOBR> night he asked for a job!” said Harry, ﬁnishing his thought. “I beg your pardon?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore’s ofﬁce! But it was still worth trying to get the <NOBR>job—then</NOBR> he might’ve got the chance to nick Gryfﬁndor’s sword as well . . . thank you, thanks!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Harry left her ﬂoating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was ﬁve minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body ﬂew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and ﬂung itself at Harry.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, ﬁghting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded ﬁgure clambered to his feet. “What <NOBR>the—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Harry, yer here! Yer here!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and <NOBR>rib-cracking</NOBR> hug, then ran back to the shattered window.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the window. “I’ll see</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the dis- tance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch. It was midnight. The battle had begun.</P>
<P class="p963 ft9">“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter ﬁght?” “Hagrid, where have you come from?”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Heard <NOBR>You-Know-Who</NOBR> from up in our cave,” said Hagrid grimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I meant, <NOBR>bu’—where’s</NOBR> Ron an’ Hermione?”</P>
<P class="p92 ft2">“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more ﬂashes of light in the dark grounds.</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels, mak- ing the ﬂoorboards quake.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn, “but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p964 ft14">The ﬁrst casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken win- dow. Their remains stirred feebly on the ﬂoor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. “Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here and crumble. . . .”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that mad <NOBR>headdress—and</NOBR> then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . .</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_525">


<P class="p40 ft2">525</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone efﬁgy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of ﬁrewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">Tom Riddle, who conﬁded in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deep- est mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at <NOBR>school—here</NOBR> at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered—</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. “Going to lob them over the <NOBR>walls—they</NOBR> won’t like this!”</P>
<P class="p46 ft11">Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang gallop- ing behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted ﬁgures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explo- sive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“It’s all righ’, <NOBR>Fang—it’s</NOBR> all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken ﬂight as slivers of china ﬂew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terriﬁed dog, leaving Harry alone.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!”</P>
<P class="p965 ft10">Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terriﬁed in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place . . . .</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“Potter!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.</P>
<P class="p966 ft9">“I’ve had hundreds of kinds thundering through my pub, Potter.” “I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, <NOBR>“Voldemort’s—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p37 ft10"><NOBR>“—attacking</NOBR> because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth. “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother would never have done it.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Your brother would never have done it . . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom . . . .</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">And then he skidded around a ﬁnal corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.</P>
<P class="p967 ft9">“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted. “Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_527">


<P class="p40 ft2">527</P>
<P class="p489 ft9"><NOBR>“Chamber—what?”</NOBR> said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. “It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t it abso-</P>
<P class="p257 ft10">lutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we had the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t gotten rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What <NOBR>the—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. “You need to speak Parseltongue!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologetically. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged modestly, “we got there in the end.”</P>
<P class="p968 ft9">“He was amazing!” said Hermione, “Amazing!” “So . . . ” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . . ”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufﬂepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Genius!” yelled Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. “So what’s new with you?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.</P>
<P class="p43 ft12">“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where every- one’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to ﬁnd it. Come one.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft9">“As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the con- cealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was</P>

<P class="p62 ft11">empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a <NOBR>moth-eaten</NOBR> hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville’s grand- mother.</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “You can tell us what’s going on.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the passage to the Hog’s Head?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“He’s ﬁghting,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p193 ft2">“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go and assist him.”</P>
<P class="p969 ft9">With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. Harry looked at Tonks.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother’s?”</P>
<P class="p505 ft9">“I couldn’t stand not <NOBR>knowing—“</NOBR> Tonks looked anguished. “She’ll look after <NOBR>him—have</NOBR> you seen Remus?”</P>
<P class="p970 ft9">“He was planning to lead a group of ﬁghters into the <NOBR>grounds—“</NOBR> Without another word, Tonks sped off.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!”</P>
<P class="p971 ft9">“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten someone!” “Who?” asked Hermione.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The <NOBR>house-elves,</NOBR> they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_529">


<P class="p40 ft2">529</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“You mean we ought to get them ﬁghting?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want anymore Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for <NOBR>us—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she ﬂung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and re- sponded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more ﬁrmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “Oi! There’s a war going on here!”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted. “D’you think you could <NOBR>just—just</NOBR> hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9"><NOBR>“Yeah—right—sorry—“</NOBR> said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situ- ation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust ﬁlled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.</P>
<P class="p119 ft9">“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams echoed from close by.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a <NOBR>well-aimed</NOBR> jinx into a crowd of ﬁghters below.</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">“Good girl!” roared a ﬁgure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair ﬂying as he led a small group of students past. “They look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.</P>
<P class="p972 ft9">“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since!” “Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s <NOBR>okay—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep <NOBR>safe—come</NOBR> on!” he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door materialized on their third run past.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of <NOBR>long-gone</NOBR> students.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here. . . .”</P>
<P class="p973 ft10">He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanish Cabinet Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequenecs, then hesitated, looking up and down aisles of junk; he could not remember we to go next. . . .</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermioen in desperation, but nothing ﬂew through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Gringotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Let’s split up.” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust of an old</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_531">


<P class="p348 ft2">531</P>
<P class="p316 ft9">man wearing a wig an a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s deﬁnitely somewhere around here. . . .”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echo- ing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . .</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. “Somewhere . . . somewhere</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">. . . ”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he rec- ognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.</P>
<P class="p90 ft9">“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“My mother,” said Draco.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situa- tion. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person: Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.”</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the ﬁght broke out . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do Diss- lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a <NOBR>die-dum!</NOBR> What’s a die- dum?”</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?”</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the ﬁfty foot moun- tain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentiﬁable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the ﬂoor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, “Finite!” and it steadied.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a <NOBR>die-dum?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with <NOBR>ill-disguised</NOBR> impatience at the <NOBR>slow-wittedness</NOBR> of his colleagues. “so that must <NOBR>mean—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“’Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You an’ your dad are ﬁnished.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_533">


<P class="p40 ft2">533</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. “What’s going on?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going <NOBR>on—no,</NOBR> Potter! Crucio!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which ﬂew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him <NOBR>alive—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s re- straining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s the <NOBR>diff—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p631 ft10">A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones.</P>
<P class="p59 ft11">“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s hesitation was all Harry needed.</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">“Expelliarmus!”</P>
<P class="p59 ft12">Goyle’s wand ﬂew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of ob- jects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full <NOBR>Body-Bind</NOBR> Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!” again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The <NOBR>wand-less</NOBR> Malfoy cowered behind a <NOBR>three-legged</NOBR> wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">a Stunning Spell as she came.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go and help <NOBR>R—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“HARRY!” she screamed.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnor- mal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“RUN!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe out- stripped all of them, now looking terriﬁed; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the ﬁre pursued them. It was not normal ﬁre; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a corner the ﬂames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the ﬁre was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of ﬁery beasts: Flam- ing serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the de- tritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.</P>
<P class="p974 ft10">Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; the ﬁery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.</P>
<P class="p266 ft9">“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the ﬁre. “What can we do?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Here!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Harry seized a pair of <NOBR>heavy-looking</NOBR> broomsticks from the nearest pile of</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_535">


<P class="p68 ft2">535</P>
<P class="p617 ft11">junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a ﬂaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed ﬁre was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of ﬂame to try to ﬁnd them, but there was nothing but ﬁre: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . .</P>
<P class="p157 ft9">“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.</P>
<P class="p73 ft9">And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terri- ble commotion, the thunder of devouring ﬂame.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10"><NOBR>“It’s—too—dangerous—!”</NOBR> Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the ﬁrestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . .</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s—</P>
<P class="p78 ft10">“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s voice, and, as a great ﬂaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.</P>
<P class="p156 ft10">“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Harry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring ﬂames were ﬂung into the air, as the creatures of</P>

<P class="p975 ft9">the cursed ﬁre cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara—</P>
<P class="p976 ft10">“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!” screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist—</P>
<P class="p108 ft10">Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air ﬁlled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.</P>
<P class="p977 ft10">Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retch- ing. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the ﬂoor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.</P>
<P class="p978 ft9"><NOBR>“C-Crabbe,”</NOBR> choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. <NOBR>“C-Crabbe . . .</NOBR> ” “He’s dead,” said Ron harshly.</P>
<P class="p976 ft10">There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent ﬁgures gal- loped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic ﬂared within him.</P>
<P class="p979 ft9">“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.”</P>
<P class="p980 ft11">“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that ﬁre?” asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. “Shall we split up and <NOBR>look—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p981 ft9">“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor ﬂoor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">537</P>
<P class="p760 ft9">stick together. I say we <NOBR>go—Harry,</NOBR> what’s that on your arm?” “What? Oh <NOBR>yeah—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p58 ft10">He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, black- ened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN’S GREATEST TREASURE.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the dia- dem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his ﬁngers.</P>
<P class="p120 ft9">“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the bro- ken piece.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Sorry?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10"><NOBR>“Fiendfyre-cursed</NOBR> <NOBR>ﬁre—it’s</NOBR> one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so <NOBR>dangerous—how</NOBR> did Crabbe know how <NOBR>to—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, re- ally,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was dead.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we can just get the <NOBR>snake—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p46 ft10">But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling ﬁlled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light ﬂew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair—</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thick-</P>

<P class="p186 ft10">“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.</P>
<P class="p187 ft9">“You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you <NOBR>were—“</NOBR></P>
<P class="p174 ft14">The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transﬁgured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed tem- porarily at bay, the world was rent apart, Harry felt himself ﬂying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them—</P>
<P class="p109 ft14">And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither ﬂame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life. . . .</P>
<P class="p233 ft12">And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three red- headed men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.</P>
<P class="p334 ft10"><NOBR>“No—no—no!”</NOBR> someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!” And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.</P>

<P class="p26 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">T</SPAN>he world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to</P>
<P class="p27 ft9">grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying—</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses ﬂew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads.</P>
<P class="p166 ft10">“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses ﬂew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ﬂoor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re going <NOBR>to—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A mon- strous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog’s descendants had joined the ﬁght.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness.</P>

<P class="p36 ft11">“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry ﬁred Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair.</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Let’s move, NOW!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, crouching low to avoid the curses ﬂying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.</P>
<P class="p36 ft14">“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was <NOBR>well-hidden,</NOBR> he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a <NOBR>bull-like</NOBR> roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling to- gether, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running af- ter Percy.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Listen to <NOBR>me—LISTEN</NOBR> RON!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I wanna <NOBR>help—I</NOBR> wanna kill Death <NOBR>Eaters—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! <NOBR>Please—Ron—we</NOBR> need the snake,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_541">


<P class="p348 ft2">541</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to ﬁght, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to ﬁnd the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was <NOBR>not—but</NOBR> he could not permit that idea to form in his mind—</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“We will ﬁght!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake! But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be <NOBR>d-doing!</NOBR> We’re the only ones who can end it!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft12">She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. “You need to ﬁnd out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the snake with him, won’t he? Do it, <NOBR>Harry—look</NOBR> inside him!”</P>
<P class="p127 ft10">Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . .</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were mufﬂed and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.</P>
<P class="p982 ft10">He was rolling his wand between his ﬁngers, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to dis- cover. . . He was conﬁdent that the boy would not ﬁnd the diadem. . . although Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he ever expected. . . too far. . . .</P>
<P class="p882 ft9">“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there was Lu- cius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks</P>

<P class="p983 ft9">of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord. . . please. . . my son. . . ”</P>
<P class="p135 ft11">“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?”</P>
<P class="p984 ft9"><NOBR>“No—never,”</NOBR> whispered Malfoy. “You must hope not.”</P>
<P class="p985 ft10"><NOBR>“Aren’t—aren’t</NOBR> you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be. . . forgive me. . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him <NOBR>y-yourself?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p986 ft10">“Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to ﬁnd me.”</P>
<P class="p986 ft10">Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his ﬁngers. It trou- bled him. . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rear- ranged. . . .</P>
<P class="p987 ft9">“Go and fetch Snape.” “Snape, <NOBR>m-my</NOBR> Lord?”</P>
<P class="p988 ft9">“Snape. Now. I need him. There is <NOBR>a—service—I</NOBR> require from him. Go.” Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room.</P>
<P class="p989 ft9">Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his ﬁngers, staring at it.</P>
<P class="p990 ft10">“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank.</P>
<P class="p991 ft10">With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.</P>
<P class="p992 ft9">“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to ﬁnd Snape.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_543">


<P class="p40 ft2">543</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">“Voldemort’s sitting in the shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged. “He’s <NOBR>not—he’s</NOBR> not even ﬁghting??”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“He doesn’t think he needs to ﬁght,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go to him.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“But why?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“He knows I’m after <NOBR>Horcruxes—he’s</NOBR> keeping Nagini close beside him— obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing—</P>
<P class="p171 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">”</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and get </SPAN><NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Harry cut across Ron.</P>
<P class="p587 ft10">“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as <NOBR>I—”</NOBR> “No,” said Hermione,, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak <NOBR>and—”</NOBR> “Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.</P>
<P class="p484 ft9">Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as <NOBR>capable—”</NOBR> the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“POTTER!”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted “Glisseo!”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">The stairs beneath their feet ﬂattened into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’ Stunning Spells ﬂew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the ﬂoor, hitting the opposite wall.</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!”</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind us—</P>
<P class="p31 ft10"><SPAN class="ft2">”</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft11">They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the ﬁghters were crammed with ﬁgures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was <NOBR>face-to-face</NOBR> with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Argh!”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">A ﬁstful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction, knocking</P>
<P class="p993 ft9">him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the ﬁghters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the mar- ble staircase into the entrance hall.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!”</P>
<P class="p994 ft10">Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked around, beam- ing, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_545">


<P class="p68 ft2">545</P>
<P class="p155 ft9">“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you <NOBR>two—faced</NOBR> bastard!” Ron yelled.</P>
<P class="p73 ft14">There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry di- rected a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.</P>
<P class="p73 ft10">Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped <NOBR>four-legged</NOBR> across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.</P>
<P class="p852 ft10">“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white ﬂash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.</P>
<P class="p75 ft9">“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. “More for any who want them! <NOBR>Here—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p77 ft10">And with a move like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall.</P>
<P class="p619 ft10">Screams of terror rent the air: the ﬁghters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light ﬂew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.</P>

<P class="p52 ft10">“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his ﬂowery pink umbrella.</P>
<P class="p995 ft9">“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled. “HAGRID, NO!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“HAGRID, COME BACK!” But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“HAGRID!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“HAGRID!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, ﬂuid move- ment, it smashed a massive ﬁst through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway.</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">“Oh <NOBR>my—!”</NOBR> shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above.</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the <NOBR>castle—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“HAGGER?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_547">


<P class="p348 ft2">547</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper ﬂoors turned around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half <NOBR>brick—sized</NOBR> teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of ﬁnding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and solidiﬁed in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling ﬁgures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of ﬁghting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way away. “Pa- tronuses, Harry, come on!” he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a promise of a feast. . . .</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, ﬂicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands out- stretched, continuing to cast Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A., “That’s right, Harry. . . come on think of something happy. . . .”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Something happy¿‘ he said, his voice cracked.</P>
<P class="p325 ft10">“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we;re still ﬁghting. Come on, now. . . .” There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of Harry’s wand. It can- tered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud</P>
<P class="p154 ft2">in his ears.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus “you just <NOBR>saved—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft11">With a roar and an <NOBR>earth-quaking</NOBR> tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them.</P>
<P class="p584 ft12">“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“The Whomping willow,” said Harry, “go!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it—</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">He sprinted, <NOBR>half—believing</NOBR> he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light ﬂying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree ﬁrst, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow’s swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak.</P>
<P class="p59 ft9"><NOBR>“How—how’re</NOBR> we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I <NOBR>can—see</NOBR> the <NOBR>place—if</NOBR> we just <NOBR>had—Crookshanks</NOBR> <NOBR>again—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“Oh—right—yeah—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said “Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig ﬂew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still.</P>
<P class="p996 ft9">“Perfect!” panted Hermione. “Wait.”</P>
<P class="p57 ft9">For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle ﬁlled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come. . . .</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p36 ft11">Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was <NOBR>low—ceilinged:</NOBR> they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went ﬁrst, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze ﬁxed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his ﬁst.</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difﬁculty he dragged it over himself, murmured, “Nox,” extin- guishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a ﬂash of green light.</P>
<P class="p52 ft12">And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly mufﬂed by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which ﬂoated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a <NOBR>long-ﬁngered</NOBR> white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“. . . my Lord, their resistance is <NOBR>crumbling—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there. . . almost.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“Let me ﬁnd the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can ﬁnd him, my Lord. Please.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_551">


<P class="p40 ft2">551</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes ﬁxed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might pene- trate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position. . . .</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the ﬂat- tened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness.</P>
<P class="p997 ft9">“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly. “My Lord?” said Snape.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor’s baton.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and <NOBR>uncoiled—or</NOBR> was it Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?</P>
<P class="p43 ft9"><NOBR>“My—my</NOBR> lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand. <NOBR>You—you</NOBR> have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordi- nary, but this wand. . . no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“No difference,” said Voldemort again.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to ﬁnd the right words to reassure his master.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">“I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . do you know why I have called you back from battle?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s proﬁle. His eyes were ﬁxed upon the</P>

<P class="p93 ft2">“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me ﬁnd Potter.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need ﬁnding. Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great ﬂaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.”</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself—</P>
<P class="p390 ft2">”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his <NOBR>friends—the</NOBR> more, the <NOBR>better—but</NOBR> do not kill him.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. <NOBR>But—let</NOBR> me go and ﬁnd the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I <NOBR>can—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft12">“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slith- ering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I ﬁnally meet the boy!”</P>
<P class="p998 ft9">“My Lord, there can be no question, <NOBR>surely—?”</NOBR> <NOBR>“—but</NOBR> there is a question, Severus. There is.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white ﬁngers, staring at Snape.</P>
<P class="p999 ft9">“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?” <NOBR>“I—I</NOBR> cannot answer that, my Lord.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Can’t you?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: he forced his own ﬁst into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_553">


<P class="p40 ft2">553</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2"><NOBR>“I—I</NOBR> have no explanation, my Lord.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still ﬁxed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“My <NOBR>Lord—let</NOBR> me go to the <NOBR>boy—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner. . . and I think I have the answer.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">Snape did not speak.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“My <NOBR>Lord—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.”</P>
<P class="p880 ft2">“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: but then Volde- mort’s intention became clear. The snake’s cage was rolling through the air,</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Kill.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bid- ding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the ﬂoor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent ﬂoated after him in its huge protective sphere.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the ﬂoor.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the ﬁngers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close.</P>
<P class="p1000 ft9">A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat. “Take. . . it. . . . Take. . . it. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p666 ft9">Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">555</P>
<P class="p410 ft2">knew what it was, but did not know what to do—</P>
<P class="p512 ft10">A ﬂask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the ﬂask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Look. . . at. . . me. . . . ” he whispered.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them ﬁxed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the ﬂoor, and Snape moved no more.</P>

<P class="p321 ft2">his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and ﬂoor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still ﬁghting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away.</P>
<P class="p82 ft9">“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery.</P>

<P class="p39 ft9">“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. <NOBR>“Let’s—let’s</NOBR> get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new <NOBR>plan—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p123 ft10">She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . .</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . One hour. . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was <NOBR>pitch-black.</NOBR> The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.</P>
<P class="p308 ft14">The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no ﬂashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The ﬂagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the ﬂoor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away.</P>
<P class="p320 ft2">“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_559">


<P class="p348 ft2">559</P>
<P class="p316 ft9">Firenze was amongst the injured; his ﬂank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who ﬂung an arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still and <NOBR>peaceful-looking,</NOBR> apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">The Great Hall seemed to ﬂy away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the ﬁrst place, Fred might never have died. . .</P>
<P class="p802 ft10">He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks. . . He yearned not to feel. . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . .</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal ﬂask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s ofﬁce.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Password?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind.</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">But when Harry burst into the circular ofﬁce he found a change. The por- traits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had ﬂitted away, charging</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung di- rectly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic mark- ings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief. . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesi- tating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging back- ward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.</P>
<P class="p193 ft12">Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister.</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.</P>
<P class="p86 ft14">But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and ﬂown into the air, quite literally ﬂown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.</P>
<P class="p320 ft2">“Mummy told you not to!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_561">


<P class="p40 ft2">561</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft2">“But I’m ﬁne,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.”</P>
<P class="p118 ft10">Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from them- selves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen ﬂower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The ﬂower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, <NOBR>many-lipped</NOBR> oyster.</P>
<P class="p408 ft2">“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground.</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the ﬂower’s ﬂight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and there was deﬁnite longing in her voice.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward to- ward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull ﬂush of color mounted the sal- low cheeks as he looked at Lily.</P>
<P class="p300 ft2">“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petu- nia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I know what you are.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p1006 ft9">“You’re. . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape. She looked affronted.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He ﬂapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watching you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Petunia’s laugh was like cold water.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. “Why have you been spying on us?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and <NOBR>dirty-haired</NOBR> in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added spitefully, “you’re a Muggle.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . .</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, <NOBR>re-formed</NOBR> around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, <NOBR>cross-legged</NOBR> on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But I have done magic outside school!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re a</P>

<P class="p268 ft9">kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly, “and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p282 ft2">“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and me.”</P>
<P class="p1007 ft2">“Really?” whispered Lily.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Deﬁnitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive ﬁgure sprawled in front of her, brim- ful of conﬁdence in his destiny.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re <NOBR>Muggle-born,</NOBR> so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Does it make a difference, being <NOBR>Muggle-born?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">“Good,” said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. “You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time I was</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">watching you. . . ”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.</P>
<P class="p1008 ft10">“How are things at your house?” Lily asked. A little crease appeared between his eyes. “Fine,” he said.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“They’re not arguing anymore?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a ﬁstful of leaves and</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. “But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Doesn’t your dad like magic?”</P>
<P class="p1009 ft9">“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape. “Severus?”</P>
<P class="p1010 ft9">A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name. “Yeah?”</P>
<P class="p1011 ft10">“Tell me about the dementors again.” “What d’you want to know about them for?” “If I use magic outside <NOBR>school—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re <NOBR>too—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft11">He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her foot- ing.</P>
<P class="p1012 ft9">“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s chest. “Your mum’s blouse?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">There was a crack. A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Tuney!”</P>
<P class="p1013 ft9">But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. “Did you make that happen?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“No.” He looked both deﬁant and scared.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You hurt her!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_565">


<P class="p40 ft2">565</P>
<P class="p239 ft2"><NOBR>“No—no,</NOBR> I didn’t!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft17">But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and con- fused. . .</P>
<P class="p716 ft14">And the scene <NOBR>re-formed.</NOBR> Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, <NOBR>sallow-faced,</NOBR> <NOBR>sour-looking</NOBR> woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“. . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! <NOBR>Listen—”</NOBR> She caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once I’m <NOBR>there—no,</NOBR> listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">“I <NOBR>don’t—want—to—go!”</NOBR> said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be <NOBR>a—a. . .</NOBR> ”</P>
<P class="p42 ft12">Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their own- ers’ arms, over the owls, ﬂuttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scar- let steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart.</P>
<P class="p239 ft2"><NOBR>“—you</NOBR> think I want to be <NOBR>a—a</NOBR> freak?”</P>
<P class="p269 ft9">Lily’s eyes ﬁlled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. “I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy. . . weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and ﬁerce.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the head- master and begged him to take you.”</P>
<P class="p1014 ft9">Petunia turned scarlet. “Beg? I didn’t beg!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I saw his reply. It was very kind.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“You shouldn’t have <NOBR>read—”</NOBR> whispered Petunia, “that was my <NOBR>private—how</NOBR> could <NOBR>you—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Lily gave herself away by <NOBR>half-glancing</NOBR> toward where Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped.</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!” <NOBR>“No—not</NOBR> <NOBR>sneaking—”</NOBR> Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw the</P>
<P class="p1015 ft10">envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care <NOBR>of—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia, now as pale as she had been ﬂushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister, and she ﬂounced off to where her parents stood. . .</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the ﬁrst opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying.</P>
<P class="p1016 ft9">“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice. “Why not?”</P>
<P class="p1017 ft9">“Tuney <NOBR>h-hates</NOBR> me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.” “So what?”</P>
<P class="p1018 ft9">She threw him a look of deep dislike. “So she’s my sister!”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_567">


<P class="p40 ft2">567</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“She’s only <NOBR>a—”</NOBR> He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. “You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had bright-</P>
<P class="p1019 ft9">ened a little. “Slytherin?”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, <NOBR>black-haired</NOBR> like Snape, but with that indeﬁnable air of having been <NOBR>well-cared-for,</NOBR> even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry real- ized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.</P>
<P class="p1020 ft10">“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. “Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!” Sirius grinned.</P>
<P class="p484 ft2">“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?”</P>
<P class="p403 ft2">James lifted an invisible sword.</P>
<P class="p1021 ft10">“’Gryfﬁndor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. “Got a problem with that?”</P>
<P class="p484 ft9">“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d rather be brawny than <NOBR>brainy—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p247 ft9">“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius. James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather ﬂushed, and looked from</P>
<P class="p179 ft2">James to Sirius in dislike.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Come on, Severus, let’s ﬁnd another compartment.”</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“Oooooo. . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door slammed. . .</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">And the scene dissolved once more. . .</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, “Evans, Lily!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft12">He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, “Gryfﬁndor!”</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryfﬁndors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and ﬁrmly turned her back on him.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryfﬁndor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . .</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">And the scene changed. . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">569</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying, “Best friends?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft12">“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary MacDonald the other day?”</P>
<P class="p286 ft9">Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.</P>
<P class="p1022 ft9">“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s <NOBR>all—”</NOBR> “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s <NOBR>funny—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?”</P>
<P class="p1023 ft9">“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s <NOBR>ill—”</NOBR> “Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">The intensity of his gaze made her blush.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down <NOBR>there—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re not going <NOBR>to—I</NOBR> won’t let <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p36 ft10">“I didn’t <NOBR>mean—I</NOBR> just don’t want to see you made a fool <NOBR>of—He</NOBR> fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. “And he’s not. . . everyone thinks. . . big Quidditch <NOBR>hero—”</NOBR> Snape’s bit- terness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting across Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with them.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step. . .</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">And the scene dissolved. . .</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the cas- tle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again. . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">The scene changed. . .</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I’m sorry.”</P>
<P class="p1024 ft9">“I’m not interested.” “I’m sorry!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Save your breath.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryfﬁndor Tower.</P>
<P class="p420 ft9">“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.” “I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it <NOBR>just—”</NOBR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_571">


<P class="p348 ft2">571</P>
<P class="p167 ft10">“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater <NOBR>friends—you</NOBR> see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to join <NOBR>You-Know-Who,</NOBR> can you?”</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.</P>
<P class="p1025 ft9">“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” <NOBR>“No—listen,</NOBR> I didn’t <NOBR>mean—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p39 ft9"><NOBR>“—to</NOBR> call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . .</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to ﬂy through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidi- ﬁed again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leaﬂess trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone. . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for—</P>
<P class="p297 ft10">Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light ﬂew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had ﬂown out of his hand.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Don’t kill me!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“That was not my intention.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.</P>
<P class="p465 ft9">“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?” <NOBR>“No—no</NOBR> <NOBR>message—I’m</NOBR> here on my own account!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling</P>

<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“I—I</NOBR> come with a <NOBR>warning—no,</NOBR> a <NOBR>request—please—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p472 ft10">Dumbledore ﬂicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still ﬂew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.</P>
<P class="p1026 ft9">“What request could a Death Eater make of me?” <NOBR>“The—the</NOBR> prophecy. . . the prediction. . . Trelawney. . . ”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?” <NOBR>“Everything—everything</NOBR> I heard!” said Snape. “That is <NOBR>why—it</NOBR> is for that</P>
<P class="p223 ft2"><NOBR>reason—he</NOBR> thinks it means Lily Evans!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It spoke of a boy born at the end of <NOBR>July—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her <NOBR>down—kill</NOBR> them <NOBR>all—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft17">“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?”</P>
<P class="p275 ft2">“I <NOBR>have—I</NOBR> have asked <NOBR>him—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, “You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p1027 ft9">“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep <NOBR>her—them—safe.</NOBR> Please.” “And what will you give me in return, Severus?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9"><NOBR>“In—in</NOBR> return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s ofﬁce, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_573">


<P class="p40 ft2">573</P>
<P class="p1028 ft9">lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. “I thought. . . you were going. . . to keep her. . . safe. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?”</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">Snape’s breathing was shallow.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to ﬂick off an irksome ﬂy.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”</P>
<P class="p1029 ft9">“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone. . . dead. . . ” “Is this remorse, Severus?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“I wish. . . I wish I were dead. . . ”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words ap- peared to take a long time to reach him.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2"><NOBR>“What—what</NOBR> do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has <NOBR>gone—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But <NOBR>never—never</NOBR> tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I can- not bear. . . especially Potter’s son. . . I want your word!”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">The ofﬁce dissolved but <NOBR>re-formed</NOBR> instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore.</P>

<P class="p37 ft10">“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transﬁguration Today. “Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I ﬁnd him an engaging child.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears ret- ribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s <NOBR>crooked-nosed</NOBR> proﬁle. “Karkaroff intends to ﬂee if the Mark burns.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted to join him?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating ﬁgures. “I am not such a coward.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . ”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . .</P>
<P class="p36 ft14">And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s ofﬁce yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, ap- parently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden po- tion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids ﬂuttered and opened.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on that ring? It</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_575">


<P class="p40 ft2">575</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”</P>
<P class="p309 ft9">Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryfﬁndor lay beside it.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Dumbledore grimaced.</P>
<P class="p1030 ft10">“I. . . was a fool. Sorely tempted. . . ” “Tempted by what?” Dumbledore did not answer.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious. “That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time <NOBR>being—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.</P>
<P class="p322 ft9">“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?” Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a</P>
<P class="p257 ft10">weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?”</P>
<P class="p283 ft10">“Something like that. . . I was delirious, no doubt. . . ” said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. “Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk</P>

<P class="p312 ft10">from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">There was a short pause.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Snape gave a stiff nod.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Good. Now then. Your ﬁrst priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft9"><NOBR>“—much</NOBR> less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Certainly not. You must kill me.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_577">


<P class="p40 ft2">577</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">“Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen within a year.”</P>
<P class="p365 ft9">“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?” “That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have</P>
<P class="p184 ft2">it ripped apart on my account.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will ﬁnish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is <NOBR>involved—I</NOBR> hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft10">His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod.</P>
<P class="p1031 ft9">Dumbledore seemed satisﬁed. “Thank you, Severus. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">The ofﬁce disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling to- gether in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted to- gether?” Snape asked abruptly.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">Dumbledore looked weary.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“He is his father over <NOBR>again—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.”</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p92 ft2">“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him. . . you do not trust me.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft11">“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.”</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">“And why may I not have the same information?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Which I do on your orders!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the con- stant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.”</P>
<P class="p325 ft10">“Yet you conﬁde much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!” “Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again,</P>
<P class="p1032 ft9">I am sure of it. Not in that way.” “I don’t understand.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like ﬂesh in <NOBR>ﬂame—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Souls? We were talking of minds!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“After you have killed me, <NOBR>Severus—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!” snarled Snape, and real anger ﬂared in the thin face now. “You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_579">


<P class="p40 ft2">579</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Come to my ofﬁce tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no conﬁdence in you. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft9">They were back in Dumbledore’s ofﬁce, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking.</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“But what must he do?”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a <NOBR>time—after</NOBR> my <NOBR>death—do</NOBR> not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical pro- tection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Tell him what?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“So the boy. . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p92 ft2">“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought. . . all those years. . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horriﬁed.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Meaning?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for <NOBR>slaughter—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p1033 ft9">“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the ofﬁce ﬂoor, bounded once across the ofﬁce, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her ﬂy away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.</P>
<P class="p1034 ft9">“After all this time?” “Always,” said Snape.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure from</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_581">


<P class="p40 ft2">581</P>
<P class="p56 ft11">his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly. . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . ”</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration.</P>
<P class="p46 ft10">“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It’s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . .</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Now Harry was ﬂying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit George instead—</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:</P>
<P class="p1035 ft9">could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind’s going, personally! Lots of love,</P>
<P class="p1036 ft2">Lily</P>
<P class="p286 ft10">Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing</P>

<P class="p86 ft9">And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait.</P>
<P class="p1037 ft9">“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The <NOBR>Mudblood—”</NOBR> “Do not use that word!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9"><NOBR>“—the</NOBR> Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmas- ter’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and <NOBR>valor—and</NOBR> he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for <NOBR>him—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryfﬁndor.</P>
<P class="p35 ft9">“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s <NOBR>mishap—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p161 ft2">Snape turned at the door.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan. . . ”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted ﬂoor in exactly the same room; Snape might just have closed the door.</P>

<P class="p27 ft14">survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he ﬂung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be ﬁnished: Neither would live, neither could survive.</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">He felt his heart pounding ﬁercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Terror washed over him as he lay on the ﬂoor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble <NOBR>phoenix-feather</NOBR> wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. This <NOBR>cold-blooded</NOBR> walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his ﬁngers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.</P>
<P class="p193 ft11">Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned that his own assumption: that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now h saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not me a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . .</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_585">


<P class="p68 ft2">585</P>
<P class="p69 ft11">But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake sur- vived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He won- dered who would do it. . . . Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . . That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to con- ﬁde in two others . . . so that if he fulﬁlled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on. . . .</P>
<P class="p852 ft17">Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard sur- face of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must doe. I must die. It must end.</P>
<P class="p1038 ft14">Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a <NOBR>far-off</NOBR> country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no <NOBR>good-byes</NOBR> and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulﬁll a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the ofﬁce door.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed.</P>
<P class="p434 ft12">Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the ﬂoors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Per- haps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily.</P>
<P class="p1039 ft9">Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was only half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull</P>

<P class="p39 ft11">“You know what? I can manage him along, Neville,” said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder if a ﬁreman’s lift and carried him into the Great Hall.</P>
<P class="p518 ft10">Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off down the stops again into the darkness to recover more bodies.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.</P>
<P class="p1040 ft9">Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body. “Neville.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got to do. <NOBR>Listen—Neville—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“No,” Harry lied easily. “’Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s name, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . . ”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_587">


<P class="p40 ft2">587</P>
<P class="p1041 ft10">“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case <NOBR>they—”</NOBR> The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again; This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville will take Harry’s place. There</P>
<P class="p689 ft2">would still be three in the secret.</P>
<P class="p1042 ft9">“Just in case <NOBR>they’re—busy—and</NOBR> you get the <NOBR>chance—”</NOBR> “Kill the snake?”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.</P>
<P class="p1043 ft9">“All right, Harry, You’re okay, are you?” “I’m ﬁne. Thanks, Neville.”</P>
<P class="p1044 ft10">But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. “We’re all going to keep ﬁghting, Harry. You know that?” “Yeah, <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p190 ft10">The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to ﬁnd it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Harry swing the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone eyes was moving not far away, stooping over another prone ﬁgure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.</P>
<P class="p1045 ft10">“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get you inside.” “But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to ﬁght anymore!” “I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all right.” Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to the</P>
<P class="p1046 ft10">night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . .</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had seen someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back.</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the ﬁre, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . .</P>
<P class="p569 ft9">He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their</P>
<P class="p674 ft11">chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . .</P>
<P class="p193 ft9">The Snitch. His nerveless ﬁngers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">I open at the close.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.</P>
<P class="p877 ft9">He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am about to die.” The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s</P>
<P class="p223 ft2">wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_589">


<P class="p40 ft2">589</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">and the stone were still discernible.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthly, <NOBR>twig-strewn</NOBR> ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around.</P>
<P class="p358 ft10">They were neither ghost nor truly ﬂesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and rufﬂed, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s.</P>
<P class="p42 ft11">Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face.</P>
<P class="p631 ft10">Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough.</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“You’ve been so brave.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.</P>
<P class="p1047 ft9">“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so proud of you.” “Does it hurt?”</P>

<P class="p1048 ft10">The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could stop it. “Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.” “And he will want to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without his voli- tion. “Any of you. I’m <NOBR>sorry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p1049 ft9">He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. <NOBR>“—right</NOBR> after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m <NOBR>sorry—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“You’ll stay with me?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Until the very end,” said James.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p1050 ft9">“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.” Harry looked at his mother.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Stay close to me,” he said quietly.</P>
<P class="p39 ft11">And he self off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would ﬁnd him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was about to keep putting one foot in front of the other.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_591">


<P class="p40 ft2">591</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">more real to him now that the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . .</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got an Invisi- bility Cloak. Could it <NOBR>be—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p46 ft10">Two ﬁgures emerged from behind a nearby tree; Their wands ﬂared and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Deﬁnitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you reckon?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Yaxley looked down at his watch.</P>
<P class="p1051 ft9">“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.” “And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Better go back,” said Yaxley, “Find out what the plan is now.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encour- agement.</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yax- ley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to ﬁght for their cause.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">A ﬁre burned in the middle of the clearing, and its ﬂickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts</P>

Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blonde Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated an terriﬁed, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">Every eye was ﬁxed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide- <NOBR>and-seek.</NOBR> Behind him head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini ﬂoated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.</P>
<P class="p1052 ft9">When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. “No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the ﬁrelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long ﬁngers.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“My <NOBR>Lord—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Bellatrix had spoken; She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping ﬂames. “I expected him to come.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. He hands were swearing as he pulled off the Invisibil- ity Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to ﬁght.</P>
<P class="p1053 ft9">“I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort. “You weren’t.”</P>
<P class="p666 ft9">Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his</P>

<P class="p41 ft10">numb ﬁngers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the ﬁrelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared at Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the ﬁre between them.</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Then a voice yelled, “HARRY! NO!”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His mas- sive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE <NOBR>YEH—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p1054 ft10">“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a ﬂick of his wand Hagrid was silenced. Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the ﬂames and the</P>
<P class="p1055 ft9">snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort’s head. Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made not attempt to</P>
<P class="p1056 ft10">draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he man- aged to point the wand at Nagini, ﬁfty curses would hit him ﬁrst. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“Harry Potter,” he said very softly His voice might have been part of the splitting ﬁre. “The Boy Who Lived.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was wait- ing. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his—</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear—</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">He saw the mouth move and a ﬂash of green light, and everything was</P>

<P class="p789 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">H</SPAN>e lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not per- fectly sure that he was there himself.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, deﬁnitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.</P>
<P class="p52 ft12">Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">He lay in a bright mist, through it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The ﬂoor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a ﬂat, blank something on which to be.</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore.</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that sur- rounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that ﬂapped, ﬂailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slight indecent. He had the uncom- fortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful.</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">For the ﬁrst time, he wished he were clothed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short dis- tance away. He took them and put them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . .</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A <NOBR>wide-open</NOBR> space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for—</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noise. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, <NOBR>ﬂayed-looking,</NOBR> and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, un- wanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">“You cannot help.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry,” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_597">


<P class="p40 ft2">597</P>
<P class="p189 ft10">and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.” Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the ﬂayed</P>
<P class="p459 ft10">child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumble- dore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind <NOBR>half-moon</NOBR> spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet. . .</P>
<P class="p539 ft2">“But you’re dead.” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p1059 ft10">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore <NOBR>matter-of-factly.</NOBR> “Then . . . I’m dead too?”</P>
<P class="p57 ft9">“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”</P>
<P class="p1060 ft10">They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. “Not?” repeated Harry.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“Not,” said Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p218 ft10">“But . . . ” Harry raised his hand instinctively towards the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have <NOBR>died—I</NOBR> didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”</P>
<P class="p587 ft10">“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the difference.” Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like ﬁre: Harry</P>
<P class="p1061 ft10">had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably, content. “Explain,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p1062 ft10">“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. “I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”</P>
<P class="p1063 ft10">“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!” “So the part of his soul that was in me . . . ”</P>
<P class="p718 ft9">Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face.</P>

<P class="p127 ft9">“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“But then . . . ”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trem- bled under the chair.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“What is that, Professor?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again “and nobody died for me this <NOBR>time—how</NOBR> can I be alive?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If this was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“He took my blood.” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“I live . . . while he lives! But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized crea- ture behind them and glanced back at it yet again.</P>
<P class="p1064 ft9">“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” “There is no help possible.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the at- tempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_599">


<P class="p348 ft2">599</P>
<P class="p519 ft9">he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the <NOBR>would-be</NOBR> victim who had survived.</P>
<P class="p1065 ft10">“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Volde- mort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of <NOBR>house-elves</NOBR> and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and under- stands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacriﬁce alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”</P>
<P class="p1066 ft9">Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. “And you knew this? You <NOBR>knew—all</NOBR> along?”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore hap- pily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“As to that, I cannot be sure.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft12">“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacriﬁce into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacriﬁce, he would not, perhaps, had dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all.</P>

</TABLE>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Having ensured this <NOBR>two-fold</NOBR> connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had never expected.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in do- ing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Volde- mort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Mal- foy’s stand?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so <NOBR>ill-advisedly</NOBR> with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other</P>
<P class="p326 ft2">. . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore ﬁnished kindly.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“He killed me with your wand.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I think we can agree you are not <NOBR>dead—though,</NOBR> of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure</P>

<P class="p410 ft2">were severe.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”</P>
<P class="p1067 ft9">“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around. “Where would you say that we are?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “Good gracious, really?”</P>
<P class="p1068 ft9">“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively. “My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remember a much more pressing question than that of their current location.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.</P>
<P class="p1069 ft9">“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried. “Well?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">For the ﬁrst time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked ﬂeetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.</P>
<P class="p39 ft2">“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate man’s dream!”</P>
<P class="p357 ft2">“But they’re real!”</P>

<P class="p127 ft11">“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.”</P>
<P class="p664 ft2">“What do I know?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in his brilliantly blue eyes.</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of <NOBR>course—how</NOBR> can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumble- dore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Hallows,” mumbled Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around.</P>
<P class="p1070 ft9">“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.”</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell <NOBR>brothers—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft14"><NOBR>“—were</NOBR> the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_603">


<P class="p40 ft2">603</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.”</P>
<P class="p1071 ft9">Dumbledore smiled at Harry. “Me?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained so much of his undetected <NOBR>wrong-doing</NOBR> at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!”</P>
<P class="p1072 ft2">His tone was unbearably bitter.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them <NOBR>curse-proof.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.”</P>
<P class="p1073 ft9">Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. “So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“But I don’t despise <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. “You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“I resented it, Harry.”</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance.</P>

<P class="p37 ft10">“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selﬁsh, Harry, more selﬁsh than you, who are a remarkably selﬂess person, could possibly imagine.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a dam- aged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bit- terness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .”</P>
<P class="p168 ft2">Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.</P>
<P class="p472 ft10">“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, in- ﬂamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindel- wald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in beneﬁts for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection <NOBR>Stone—to</NOBR> him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">“And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’</P>
<P class="p330 ft2">“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">605</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and inﬁnitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">“The argument became a ﬁght. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I had pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the ﬂoor.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to ﬁnd that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control.</P>
<P class="p172 ft10">“Well, Grindelwald ﬂed, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft9">“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!” burst out Harry.</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and ﬁnd to their own surprise that they wear it well.</P>

<P class="p92 ft2">“You were the <NOBR>best—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p31 ft10"><NOBR>“—you</NOBR> are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.</P>
<P class="p63 ft11">“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horriﬁc ﬁght, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“I think he knew it. I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until ﬁnally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.</P>
<P class="p499 ft10">“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.” Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out</P>
<P class="p927 ft10">who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmen- gard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . ”</P>

<P class="p195 ft9">“. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dumb- ledore dabbed his eyes.</P>
<P class="p43 ft2">After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.”</P>
<P class="p403 ft2">Dumbledore nodded.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the <NOBR>Gaunts—the</NOBR> Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different <NOBR>reasons—I</NOBR> lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was . . .</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deadly Hallows. I had proved it time and again, and here was the ﬁnal proof.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was ﬁt only to possess the meanest one of them, the least extraordinary. I was ﬁt to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my <NOBR>self-sacriﬁce,</NOBR> as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft10">Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumble- dore now?</P>
<P class="p1074 ft9">“Why did you have to make it so difﬁcult?” Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous.</P>
<P class="p718 ft9">“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if pre-</P>

If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the ﬁrst. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“But you expected him to go after the wand?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft12">“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At ﬁrst, he was afraid that you had con- quered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained ev- erything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to ﬁnd the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus. . . .”</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I had intended, did it?”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would</P>

<P class="p519 ft9">happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow.</P>
<P class="p1075 ft9">“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” “That is up to you.”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“I’ve got a choice?”</P>
<P class="p227 ft9">“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">. . . board a train.”</P>
<P class="p1076 ft10">“And where would it take me?” “On,” said Dumbledore simply. Silence again.</P>
<P class="p1077 ft10">“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.” “True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.” “But you want me to go back?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“I think,” said Dumbledore, ”that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be ﬁnished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Harry glanced again at the <NOBR>raw-looking</NOBR> thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say <NOBR>good-bye</NOBR> for the present.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this been happen- ing inside my head?”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s</P>

<P class="p442 ft10">sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an <NOBR>iron-clad</NOBR> punch. He did not stir but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs ﬁlled the air.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“My Lord . . . my Lord . . . ”</P>
<P class="p160 ft14">It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament.

<P class="p62 ft9">perate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a mil- limeter.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hur- rying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen brieﬂy unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . .</P>
<P class="p292 ft2">“My Lord, let <NOBR>me—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The boy . . . Is he dead?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terriﬁed a ﬁnger or an eyelid might twitch.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . .</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face. He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Yes,” he breathed back.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_613">


<P class="p40 ft2">613</P>
<P class="p195 ft9">He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up.</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and ﬁnd her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won.</P>
<P class="p42 ft9">“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!”</P>
<P class="p43 ft14">Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest ﬂoor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses ﬂew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself ﬂoppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.</P>
<P class="p218 ft9">“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? <NOBR>No—Wait—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p43 ft9">There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moment Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“You carry him,” Voldemort said, “He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the <NOBR>glasses—put</NOBR> on the <NOBR>glasses—he</NOBR> must be <NOBR>recognizable—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Someone slammed Harry’s glasses onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet,</P>

<P class="p1080 ft10">“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the <NOBR>close-growing</NOBR> trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Ha- grid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . .</P>
<P class="p1081 ft10">The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“BANE!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open. “Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ ﬁght, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh happy Harry <NOBR>Potter’s—d-dead . . .</NOBR> ?”</P>
<P class="p29 ft10">Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by the freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“Stop.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort’s com- mand, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart.</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort him- self because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magniﬁed so that it</P>

<P class="p31 ft10">“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.</P>
<P class="p38 ft14">“The battle is won. You have lost half of your ﬁghters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is ﬁnished. There must be no more war. Anybody who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. . . .</P>
<P class="p159 ft2">“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . . ”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Stop.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms.</P>
<P class="p66 ft2">“NO!”</P>

He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway ﬁlling with peo- ple, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s death for themselves. He saw Volde- mort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s head with a single white ﬁnger. He closed his eyes again.</P>
<P class="p1082 ft9">“No!” “No!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Harry! HARRY!”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGonagall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until—</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a ﬂash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It’s over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and for- ward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry Potter is dead! Do you under- stand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacriﬁce themselves for him!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hog- warts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said Volde- mort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save <NOBR>himself—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p30 ft10">But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scufﬂe and a shout, then another bang, a ﬂash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an inﬁnitesi- mal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort:</P>

<DIV id="page_617">


<P class="p40 ft2">617</P>
<P class="p268 ft9">Harry saw the ﬁgure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the chal- lenger’s wand aside and laughing.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to ﬁght when the battle is lost?”</P>
<P class="p307 ft2">Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Car- rows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no- <NOBR>man’s-land</NOBR> between the survivors and the Death Eaters. “But you are a pure- blood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled into ﬁsts.</P>
<P class="p122 ft2">“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said quietly, “be it.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird ﬂew through the half light and landed in Volde- mort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort. “There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will sufﬁce for everyone. Won’t they, Neville Longbottom?”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the</P>

<P class="p164 ft10">hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the ﬁghters of Hogwarts at bay.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a ﬂick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into ﬂames.</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aﬂame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act—</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">And then many things happened at the same moment.</P>
<P class="p35 ft11">They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the <NOBR>out-of-sight</NOBR> walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull ele- phants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">In one swift, ﬂuid motion, Neville broke free of the <NOBR>Body-Bind</NOBR> Curse upon; the ﬂaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle—</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light ﬂooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet—</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Ha- grid’s yell came loudest of all</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_619">


<P class="p40 ft2">619</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. <NOBR>“HARRY—WHERE’S</NOBR> HARRY?”</P>
<P class="p59 ft14">Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, ev- eryone was ﬂeeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them, and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shouting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.</P>
<P class="p58 ft11">Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the en- trance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, ﬁring spells from his wand as he backed into the Great hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses ﬂying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort’s <NOBR>would-be</NOBR> victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the ﬁght already ﬂourishing inside it.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to ﬁght, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Ban, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">The <NOBR>house-elves</NOBR> of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regu- lus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of the <NOBR>house-elves!</NOBR> Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”</P>

<P class="p36 ft10">They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging ar- rows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.</P>
<P class="p52 ft9">But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling pris- oners, and into the Great Hall.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the ﬂoor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aber- forth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy ﬂooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to ﬁght, screaming for their son.</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to ﬁnish him—</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Bellatrix was still ﬁghting too, ﬁfty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch—</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a</P>

<P class="p348 ft2">621</P>
<P class="p331 ft10">swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange’s smile fal- tered and became a snarl. Jets of light ﬂew from both wands, the ﬂoor around the witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both women were ﬁghting to kill.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!”</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two ﬁghts, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”</P>
<P class="p1083 ft10"><NOBR>“You—will—never—touch—our—children—again!”</NOBR> screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was</P>
<P class="p326 ft2">going to happen before it did.</P>
<P class="p1084 ft9">Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes began to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kings- ley, and Slughorn blasted backward, ﬂailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!” “HE’S ALIVE!” were stiﬂed at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly</P>

<P class="p62 ft9">and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“I don’t want anyone else to try to help.” Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Voldemort hissed.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .”</P>
<P class="p38 ft12">“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taunt and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?”</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided to ﬁght in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to ﬁght again?”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watch- ing crowd was frozen as if Petriﬁed, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and per- mitted me to kill them for you!”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these <NOBR>people—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“But you did not!”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2"><NOBR>“—I</NOBR> meant to, and that’s what it did. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_623">


<P class="p40 ft2">623</P>
<P class="p41 ft10">protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“You <NOBR>dare—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held back by the faintest possi- bility that Harry might indeed know a ﬁnal secret. . . .</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering. “Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cock- roach, <NOBR>Potter—and</NOBR> nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you from dying now when I strike?”</P>
<P class="p182 ft9">“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.</P>
<P class="p43 ft11">“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?”</P>
<P class="p102 ft10">“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock ﬂit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.</P>
<P class="p59 ft11">“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?”</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to dare, too weak</P>

<P class="p220 ft9">“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.” “I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">For the ﬁrst time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle. I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!”</P>
<P class="p411 ft10">”Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft9">“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumbledore’s Dum- bledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?”</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other, like wolves about to tear each other apart.</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry,“the same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils ﬂare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”</P>
<P class="p374 ft10">“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of <NOBR>him—”</NOBR> “Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since!</P>
<P class="p327 ft2">Dumbledore was already dying when Snape ﬁnished him!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_625">


<P class="p348 ft2">625</P>
<P class="p316 ft12">whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand!</P>
<P class="p213 ft10">“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little <NOBR>boy—I</NOBR> reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up, I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“What is this?”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contact to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.</P>
<P class="p31 ft9">“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“You <NOBR>dare—?”</NOBR> said Voldemort again.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backﬁred on me at all. It’s backﬁred on you, Riddle.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“He <NOBR>killed—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p1085 ft10">“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died</P>

<P class="p34 ft2">with him, because it had never been won from him!”</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! It’s power is mine!”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Olli- vander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . .</P>
<P class="p167 ft9">Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse com- ing, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”</P>
<P class="p1086 ft10">Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. “But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand:</P>
<P class="p290 ft9">We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there ﬁrst. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">A <NOBR>red-gold</NOBR> glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a ﬂaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand:</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_627">


<P class="p68 ft2">627</P>
<P class="p1087 ft10">“Avada Kedavra!” “Expelliarmus!”</P>
<P class="p77 ft11">The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden ﬂames that erupted be- tween them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand ﬂy high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scar- let eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the ﬂoor with a mundane ﬁnality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands, staring down at his enemy’s shell.</P>
<P class="p619 ft12">One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspend: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The ﬁerce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the ﬁrst to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Spout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last—</P>
<P class="p619 ft10">The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of ju- bilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to on one. He must speak to the bereaved, clap their hands, witness their tears,</P>

<P class="p31 ft11">They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and ﬁfty others who had died ﬁghting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and <NOBR>house-elves,</NOBR> and Firenze lay recov- ering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and peo- ple were through food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.</P>
<P class="p1088 ft9">“I’d want some peace and quite, if it were me,” she said. “I’d love some,” he replied.</P>
<P class="p161 ft2">“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”</P>
<P class="p235 ft10">And before he could say a word she cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.</P>
<P class="p63 ft11">Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoul- der: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryfﬁndor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and ﬁnally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will you come with me?”</P>

<P class="p1089 ft9">Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade was gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed.</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:</P>
<P class="p1090 ft2">We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one,</P>
<P class="p1091 ft2">And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!</P>
<P class="p518 ft9">“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.</P>
<P class="p123 ft11">Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was mufﬂed by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But ﬁrst he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the head- master’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch- drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. “Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“Feel free.” groaned the statue.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort—</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and head mis- tresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each</P>

<P class="p62 ft14">other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his <NOBR>ear-trumpet;</NOBR> and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!”</P>
<P class="p160 ft10">But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait di- rectly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the <NOBR>half-moon</NOBR> spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him ﬁlled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and <NOBR>bleary-eyed</NOBR> though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice.</P>
<P class="p86 ft10">“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?”</P>
<P class="p30 ft10">“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked con- fused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.</P>
<P class="p1092 ft9">“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” “And then there’s this.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and <NOBR>sleep-deprived</NOBR> state, Harry did not like to see.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“I don’t want it.” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“What?” said Ron Loudly. “Are you mental?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“I know it’s powerful,” said Ron wearily. “But I was happier with mine. So</P>

<P class="p178 ft2">. . . ”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the ﬁnest thread of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touch it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said “Reparo.”</P>
<P class="p192 ft10">As his wand resealed, red sparks ﬂew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his ﬁngers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And quite hon- estly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four- poster bead lying waiting for him in Gryfﬁndor Tower and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”</P>

<P class="p1093 ft4"><NOBR>Epilogue—Nineteen</NOBR> Years</P>
<P class="p690 ft4">Later</P>
<P class="p1094 ft2"><SPAN class="ft8">A</SPAN>utumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the ﬁrst of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road towards the great</P>
<P class="p442 ft10">sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large caged rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm.</P>
<P class="p1095 ft9">“It won’t be long now, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her. “Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!”</P>
<P class="p123 ft10">The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.</P>
<P class="p1096 ft9">“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!” “James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother. “There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in <NOBR>Slyth—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p1097 ft10">But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The ﬁve Potters ap- proached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A mo- ment later, he had vanished.</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">“You’ll right to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately, capi- talizing on the momentary absence of his brother.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.”</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,” Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft14">Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and <NOBR>three-quarters,</NOBR> which was obscured by thick white steam which was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. In- distinct ﬁgures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.</P>
<P class="p81 ft9">“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“We’ll ﬁnd them,” said Ginny reassuringly.</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">But the vapor was dense, and it was difﬁcult to make out anybody’s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .</P>
<P class="p89 ft2">“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up beside them.</P>
<P class="p88 ft2">“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">Rose, who was already wearing her <NOBR>brand-new</NOBR> Hogwarts robes, beamed at</P>

<P class="p40 ft2">635</P>
<P class="p178 ft2">him.</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.”</P>
<P class="p255 ft2">“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as to- gether they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they ﬁnally went to Hogwarts.</P>
<P class="p365 ft9">“If you’re not in Gryfﬁndor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.” “Ron!”</P>
<P class="p191 ft2">Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some ﬁfty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“Look who it is.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat but- toned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.</P>
<P class="p282 ft9">“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s brains.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft9">“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never for- give you if you married a pureblood.”</P>

<P class="p85 ft2">“Hey!”</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trol- ley, and was evidently bursting with news.</P>
<P class="p63 ft10">“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And guess what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!”</P>
<P class="p499 ft9">He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. “Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked</P>
<P class="p221 ft2">Teddy what he was <NOBR>doing—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p93 ft2">“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like <NOBR>Ron—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p86 ft11"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away! He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.</P>
<P class="p153 ft9">“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married,” whispered Lily sarcastically. “Teddy would really be part of the family then!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry. “Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?”</P>
<P class="p39 ft9">“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing a room with <NOBR>Al—Teddy</NOBR> could have my room!”</P>
<P class="p30 ft9">“No,” said Harry ﬁrmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.”</P>
<P class="p1098 ft9">He checked the battered old watch which had once been Fabian Prewett’s. “It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”</P>
<P class="p228 ft9">“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged him. “Mum! I can’t give a professor love!”</P>
<P class="p1099 ft9">“But you know <NOBR>Neville!—”</NOBR> James rolled his eyes.</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . . ”</P>
<P class="p91 ft9">Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aim- ing a kick at Albus.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_637">


<P class="p40 ft2">637</P>
<P class="p239 ft2">“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his fa- ther a ﬂeeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly ﬁlling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to ﬁnd his friends.</P>
<P class="p190 ft10">“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus. “They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.”</P>
<P class="p1100 ft9">Ginny kissed Albus <NOBR>good-by.</NOBR> “See you at Christmas.”</P>
<P class="p171 ft10">“By, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“What if I’m in Slytherin?”</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.</P>
<P class="p361 ft9">Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">“But just <NOBR>say—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p42 ft10"><NOBR>“—then</NOBR> Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryfﬁndor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”</P>
<P class="p49 ft2">“Really?”</P>
<P class="p197 ft2">“It did for me,” said Harry.</P>
<P class="p45 ft9">He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the</P>

<P class="p331 ft10">scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for ﬁnal kisses, <NOBR>last-minute</NOBR> reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned towards Harry.</P>
<P class="p160 ft9">“Why are they staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.”</P>
<P class="p39 ft10">Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excite- ment. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereave- ment, watching his son glide away from him. . . .</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.</P>
<P class="p86 ft9">As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">“I know he will.”</P>
<P class="p93 ft2">The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.</P>
